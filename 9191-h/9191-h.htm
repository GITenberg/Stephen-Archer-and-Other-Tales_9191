    <h2>
      STEPHEN ARCHER
    </h2>
    <p>
      Stephen Archer was a stationer, bookseller, and newsmonger in one of the
      suburbs of London. The newspapers hung in a sort of rack at his door, as
      if for the convenience of the public to help themselves in passing. On his
      counter lay penny weeklies and books coming out in parts, amongst which
      the <i>Family Herald</i> was in force, and the <i>London Journal</i> not
      to be found. I had occasion once to try the extent of his stock, for I
      required a good many copies of one of Shakspere's plays&mdash;at a penny,
      if I could find such. He shook his head, and told me he could not
      encourage the sale of such productions. This pleased me; for, although it
      was of little consequence what he thought concerning Shakspere, it was of
      the utmost import that he should prefer principle to pence. So I loitered
      in the shop, looking for something to buy; but there was nothing in the
      way of literature: his whole stock, as far as I could see, consisted of
      little religious volumes of gay binding and inferior print; he had nothing
      even from the Halifax press. He was a good-looking fellow, about thirty,
      with dark eyes, overhanging brows that indicated thought, mouth of
      character, and no smile. I was interested in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked if he would mind getting the plays I wanted. He said he would
      rather not. I bade him good morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      More than a year after, I saw him again. I had passed his shop many times,
      but this morning, I forget why, I went in. I could hardly recall the
      former appearance of the man, so was it swallowed up in a new expression.
      His face was alive, and his behaviour courteous. A similar change had
      passed upon his stock. There was <i>Punch</i> and <i>Fun</i> amongst the
      papers, and tenpenny Shaksperes on the counter, printed on straw-paper,
      with ugly wood-cuts. The former class of publications had not vanished,
      but was mingled with cheap editions of some worthy of being called books.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see you have changed your mind since I saw you last," I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have the advantage of me, sir," he returned. "I did not know you were
      a customer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not much of that," I replied; "only in intention. I wanted you to get me
      some penny Shaksperes, and you would not take the order."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! I think I remember," he answered, with just a trace of confusion;
      adding, with a smile, "I'm married now;" and I fancied I could read a sort
      of triumph over his former self.
    </p>
    <p>
      I laughed, of course&mdash;the best expression of sympathy at hand&mdash;and,
      after a little talk, left the shop, resolved to look in again soon. Before
      a month was over, I had made the acquaintance of his wife too, and between
      them learned so much of their history as to be able to give the following
      particulars concerning it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stephen Archer was one of the deacons, rather a young one perhaps, of a
      dissenting congregation. The chapel was one of the oldest in the
      neighbourhood, quite triumphant in ugliness, but possessed of a history
      which gave it high rank with those who frequented it. The sacred odour of
      the names of pastors who had occupied its pulpit, lingered about its walls&mdash;names
      unknown beyond its precincts, but starry in the eyes of those whose world
      lay within its tabernacle. People generally do not know what a power some
      of these small <i>conventicles</i> are in the education of the world. If
      only as an outlet for the energies of men of lowly education and position,
      who in connexion with most of the churches of the Establishment would find
      no employment, they are of inestimable value.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Stephen Archer, for instance, when I saw him first, his chapel was the
      sole door out of the common world into the infinite. When he entered, as
      certainly did the awe and the hush of the sacred place overshadow his
      spirit as if it had been a gorgeous cathedral-house borne aloft upon the
      joined palms of its Gothic arches. The Master is truer than men think, and
      the power of His presence, as Browning has so well set forth in his
      "Christmas Eve," is where two or three are gathered in His name. And
      inasmuch as Stephen was not a man of imagination, he had the greater need
      of the undefined influences of the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been chief in establishing a small mission amongst the poor in the
      neighbourhood, with the working of which he occupied the greater part of
      his spare time. I will not venture to assert that his mind was pure from
      the ambition of gathering from these to swell the flock at the little
      chapel; nay, I will not even assert that there never arose a suggestion of
      the enemy that the pence of these rescued brands might alleviate the
      burden upon the heads and shoulders of the poorly prosperous caryatids of
      his church; but I do say that Stephen was an honest man in the main, ever
      ready to grow honester: and who can demand more?
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening, as he was putting up the shutters of his window, his
      attention was arrested by a shuffling behind him. Glancing round, he set
      down the shutter, and the next instant boxed a boy's ears, who ran away
      howling and mildly excavating his eyeballs, while a young, pale-faced
      woman, with the largest black eyes he had ever seen, expostulated with him
      on the proceeding.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, sir!" she said, "he wasn't troubling you." There was a touch of
      indignation in the tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry I can't return the compliment," said Stephen, rather
      illogically. "If I'd ha' known you liked to have your shins kicked, I
      might ha' let the young rascal alone. But you see I didn't know it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's my brother," said the young woman, conclusively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The more shame to him," returned Stephen. "If he'd been your husband,
      now, there might ha' been more harm than good in interferin', 'cause he'd
      only give it you the worse after; but brothers! Well, I'm sure it's a pity
      I interfered."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't see the difference," she retorted, still with offence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg your pardon, then," said Stephen. "I promise you I won't interfere
      next time."
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he turned, took up his shutter, and proceeded to close his
      shop. The young woman walked on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stephen gave an inward growl or two at the depravity of human nature, and
      set out to make his usual visits; but before he reached the place, he had
      begun to doubt whether the old Adam had not overcome him in the matter of
      boxing the boy's ears; and the following interviews appeared in
      consequence less satisfactory than usual. Disappointed with himself, he
      could not be so hopeful about others.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he was descending a stair so narrow that it was only just possible for
      two people to pass, he met the same young woman ascending. Glad of the
      opportunity, he stepped aside with his best manners and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sorry I offended you this evening. I did not know that the boy was
      your brother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, sir!" she returned&mdash;for to one in her position, Stephen Archer
      was a gentleman: had he not a shop of his own?&mdash;"you didn't hurt him
      much; only I'm so anxious to save him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure," returned Stephen, "that is the one thing needful."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir," she rejoined. "I try hard, but boys will be boys."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is but one way, you know," said Stephen, following the words with a
      certain formula which I will not repeat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl stared. "I don't know about that," she said. "What I want is to
      keep him out of prison. Sometimes I think I shan't be able long. Oh, sir!
      if you be the gentleman that goes about here, couldn't you help me? I
      can't get anything for him to do, and I can't be at home to look after
      him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is he about all day, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The streets," she answered. "I don't know as he's ever done anything he
      oughtn't to, but he came home once in a fright, and that breathless with
      running, that I thought he'd ha' fainted. If I only could get him into a
      place!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you live here?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir; I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      At the moment a half-bestial sound below, accompanied by uncertain
      footsteps, announced the arrival of a drunken bricklayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's Joe Bradley," she said, in some alarm. "Come into my room, sir,
      till he's gone up; there's no harm in him when he's sober, but he ain't
      been sober for a week now."
    </p>
    <p>
      Stephen obeyed; and she, taking a key from her pocket, and unlocking a
      door on the landing, led him into a room to which his back-parlour was a
      paradise. She offered him the only chair in the room, and took her place
      on the edge of the bed, which showed a clean but much-worn patchwork
      quilt. Charley slept on the bed, and she on a shake-down in the corner.
      The room was not untidy, though the walls and floor were not clean; indeed
      there were not in it articles enough to make it untidy withal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where do you go on Sundays?" asked Stephen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nowheres. I ain't got nobody," she added, with a smile, "to take me
      nowheres."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you do then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've plenty to do mending of Charley's trousers. You see they're only
      shoddy, and as fast as I patch 'em in one place they're out in another."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you oughtn't to work Sundays."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have heard tell of people as say you oughtn't to work of a Sunday; but
      where's the differ when you've got a brother to look after? He ain't got
      no mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you're breaking the fourth commandment; and you know where people go
      that do that. You believe in hell, I suppose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I always thought that was a bad word."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure! But it's where you'll go if you break the Sabbath."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, sir!" she said, bursting into tears, "I don't care what become of me
      if I could only save that boy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean by <i>saving</i> him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Keep him out of prison, to be sure. I shouldn't mind the workus myself,
      if I could get him into a place."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>A place</i> was her heaven, a prison her hell. Stephen looked at her
      more attentively. No one who merely glanced at her could help seeing her
      eyes first, and no one who regarded them could help thinking her
      nice-looking at least, all in a shabby cotton dress and black shawl as she
      was. It was only the "penury and pine" that kept her from being beautiful.
      Her features were both regular and delicate, with an anxious mystery about
      the thin tremulous lips, and a beseeching look, like that of an animal, in
      her fine eyes, hazy with the trouble that haunted her mouth. Stephen had
      the good sense not to press the Sabbath question, and by degrees drew her
      story from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father had been a watchmaker, but, giving way to drink, had been, as
      far back as she could remember, entirely dependent on her mother, who by
      charing and jobbing managed to keep the family alive. Sara was then the
      only child, but, within a few months after her father's death, her mother
      died in giving birth to the boy. With her last breath she had commended
      him to his sister. Sara had brought him up&mdash;how she hardly knew. He
      had been everything to her. The child that her mother had given her was
      all her thought. Those who start with the idea "that people with nought
      are naughty," whose eyes are offended by rags, whose ears cannot
      distinguish between vulgarity and wickedness, and who think the first duty
      is care for self, must be excused from believing that Sara Coulter passed
      through all that had been <i>decreed</i> for her without losing her
      simplicity and purity. But God is in the back slums as certainly as&mdash;perhaps
      to some eyes more evidently than&mdash;in Belgravia. That which was the
      burden of her life&mdash;namely, the care of her brother&mdash;was her
      salvation. After hearing her story, which he had to draw from her, because
      she had no impulse to talk about herself, Stephen went home to turn the
      matter over in his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next Sunday, after he had had his dinner, he went out into the same
      region, and found himself at Sara's door. She was busy over a garment of
      Charley's, who was sitting on the bed with half a loaf in his hand. When
      he recognized Stephen he jumped down, and would have rushed from the room;
      but changing his mind, possibly because of the condition of his lower
      limbs, he turned, and springing into the bed, scrambled under the
      counterpane, and drew it over his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sorry to see you working on Sunday," Stephen said, with an emphasis
      that referred to their previous conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You would not have the boy go naked?" she returned, with again a touch of
      indignation. She had been thinking how easily a man of Stephen's social
      position could get him a place if he would. Then recollecting her manners,
      she added, "I should get him better clothes if he had a place. Wouldn't
      you like to get a place now, Charley?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Charley, from under the counterpane, and began to peep at the
      visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not an ill-looking boy&mdash;only roguish to a degree. His eyes, as
      black as his sister's, but only half as big, danced and twinkled with
      mischief. Archer would have taken him off to his ragged class, but even of
      rags he had not at the moment the complement necessary for admittance. He
      left them, therefore, with a few commonplaces of religious phrase, falling
      utterly meaningless. But he was not one to confine his ministrations to
      words: he was an honest man. Before the next Sunday it was clear to him
      that he could do nothing for the soul of Sara until he had taken the
      weight of her brother off it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he called the next Sunday the same vision precisely met his view. She
      might have been sitting there ever since, with those wonderfully-patched
      trousers in her hands, and the boy beside her, gnawing at his lump of
      bread. But many a long seam had passed through her fingers since then, for
      she worked at a clothes-shop all the week with the sewing-machine, whence
      arose the possibility of patching Charley's clothes, for the overseer
      granted her a cutting or two now and then.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a little chat, Stephen put the question:
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I find a place for Charley, will you go to Providence Chapel next
      Sunday?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will go <i>anywhere</i> you please, Mr. Archer," she answered, looking
      up quickly with a flushed face. She would have accompanied him to any
      casino in London just as readily: her sole thought was to keep Charley out
      of prison. Her father had been in prison once; to keep her mother's child
      out of prison was the grand object of her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," he resumed, with some hesitation, for he had arrived at the
      resolution through difficulties, whose fogs yet lingered about him, "if he
      will be an honest, careful boy, I will take him myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Charley! Charley!" cried Sara, utterly neglectful of the source of the
      benefaction; and rising, she went to the bed and hugged him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't, Sara!" said Charley, petulantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't want girls to squash me. Leave go, I say. You mend my trousers,
      and <i>I</i> 'll take care of <i>my</i>self."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The little wretch!" thought Stephen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sara returned to her seat, and her needle went almost as fast as her
      sewing-machine. A glow had arisen now, and rested on her pale cheek:
      Stephen found himself staring at a kind of transfiguration, back from the
      ghostly to the human. His admiration extended itself to her deft and
      slender fingers and there brooded until his conscience informed him that
      he was actually admiring the breaking of the Sabbath; whereupon he rose.
      But all the time he was about amongst the rest of his people, his thoughts
      kept wandering back to the desolate room, the thankless boy, and the
      ministering woman. Before leaving, however, he had arranged with Sara that
      she should bring her brother to the shop the next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The awe with which she entered it was not shared by Charley, who was never
      ripe for anything but frolic. Had not Stephen been influenced by a desire
      to do good, and possibly by another feeling too embryonic for detection,
      he would never have dreamed of making an errand boy of a will-o'-the-wisp.
      As such, however, he was installed, and from that moment an anxiety
      unknown before took possession of Stephen's bosom. He was never at ease,
      for he never knew what the boy might be about. He would have parted with
      him the first fortnight, but the idea of the prison had passed from Sara's
      heart into his, and he saw that to turn the boy away from his first place
      would be to accelerate his gravitation thitherward. He had all the tricks
      of a newspaper boy indigenous in him. Repeated were the complaints brought
      to the shop. One time the paper was thrown down the area, and brought into
      the breakfast-room defiled with wet. At another it was found on the
      door-step, without the bell having been rung, which could hardly have been
      from forgetfulness, for Charley's delight was to set the bell ringing
      furiously, and then wait till the cook appeared, taking good care however
      to leave space between them for a start. Sometimes the paper was not
      delivered at all, and Stephen could not help suspecting that he had sold
      it in the street. Yet both for his sake and Sara's he endured, and did not
      even box his ears. The boy hardly seemed to be wicked: the spirit that
      possessed him was rather a <i>polter-geist</i>, as the Germans would call
      it, than a demon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, the Sunday after Charley's appointment, Archer, seated in his
      pew, searched all the chapel for the fulfilment of Sara's part of the
      agreement, namely, her presence. But he could see her nowhere. The fact
      was, her promise was so easy that she had scarcely thought of it after,
      not suspecting that Stephen laid any stress upon its fulfilment, and,
      indeed, not knowing where the chapel was. She had managed to buy a hit of
      something of the shoddy species, and while Stephen was looking for her in
      the chapel, she was making a jacket for Charley. Greatly disappointed, and
      chiefly, I do believe, that she had not kept her word, Stephen went in the
      afternoon to call upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found her working away as before, and saving time by taking her dinner
      while she worked, for a piece of bread lay on the table by her elbow, and
      beside it a little brown sugar to make the bread go down. The sight went
      to Stephen's heart, for he had just made his dinner off baked mutton and
      potatoes, washed down with his half-pint of stout.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sara!" he said solemnly, "you promised to come to our chapel, and you
      have not kept your word." He never thought that "our chapel" was not the
      landmark of the region.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Mr. Archer," she answered, "I didn't know as you cared about it.
      But," she went on, rising and pushing her bread on one side to make room
      for her work, "I'll put on my bonnet directly." Then she checked herself,
      and added, "Oh! I beg your pardon, sir&mdash;I'm so shabby! You couldn't
      be seen with the likes of me."
    </p>
    <p>
      It touched Stephen's chivalry&mdash;and something deeper than chivalry. He
      had had no intention of walking with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's no chapel in the afternoon," he said; "but I'll come and fetch
      you in the evening."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it came about that Sara was seated in Stephen's pew, next to Stephen
      himself, and Stephen felt a strange pleasure unknown before, like that of
      the shepherd who having brought the stray back to the fold cares little
      that its wool is torn by the bushes, and it looks a ragged and
      disreputable sheep. It was only Sara's wool that might seem disreputable,
      for she was a very good-faced sheep. He found the hymns for her, and they
      shared the same book. He did not know then that Sara could not read a word
      of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gathered people, the stillness, the gaslights, the solemn ascent of
      the minister into the pulpit, the hearty singing of the congregation,
      doubtless had their effect upon Sara, for she had never been to a chapel
      and hardly to any place of assembly before. From all amusements, the
      burden of Charley and her own retiring nature had kept her back.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she could make nothing of the sermon. She confessed afterwards that
      she did not know she had anything to do with it. Like "the Northern
      Farmer," she took it all for the clergyman's business, which she amongst
      the rest had to see done. She did not even wonder why Stephen should have
      wanted to bring her there. She sat when other people sat, pretended to
      kneel when other people pretended to kneel, and stood up when other people
      stood up&mdash;still brooding upon Charley's jacket.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Archer's feelings were not those he had expected. He had brought her,
      intending her to be done good to; but before the sermon was over he wished
      he had not brought her. He resisted the feeling for a long time, but at
      length yielded to it entirely; the object of his solicitude all the while
      conscious only of the lighted stillness and the new barrier between
      Charley and Newgate. The fact with regard to Stephen was that a certain
      hard <i>pan</i>, occasioned by continual ploughings to the same depth and
      no deeper, in the soil of his mind, began this night to be broken up from
      within, and that through the presence of a young woman who did not for
      herself put together two words of the whole discourse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pastor was preaching upon the saying of St. Paul, that he could wish
      himself accursed from Christ for his brethren. Great part of his sermon
      was an attempt to prove that he could not have meant what his words
      implied. For the preacher's mind was so filled with the supposed paramount
      duty of saving his own soul, that the enthusiasm of the Apostle was simply
      incredible. Listening with that woman by his side, Stephen for the first
      time grew doubtful of the wisdom of his pastor. Nor could he endure that
      such should be the first doctrine Sara heard from his lips. Thus was he
      already and grandly repaid for his kindness; for the presence of a woman
      who without any conscious religion was to herself a law of love, brought
      him so far into sympathy with the mighty soul of St. Paul, that from that
      moment the blessing of doubt was at work in his, undermining prison walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked home with Sara almost in silence, for he found it impossible to
      impress upon her those parts of the sermon with which he had no fault to
      find, lest she should retort upon that one point. The arrows which Sara
      escaped, however, could from her ignorance have struck her only with their
      feather end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Things proceeded in much the same fashion for a while. Charley went home
      at night to his sister's lodging, generally more than two hours after
      leaving the shop, but gave her no new ground of complaint. Every Sunday
      evening Sara went to the chapel, taking Charley with her when she could
      persuade him to go; and, in obedience with the supposed wish of Stephen,
      sat in his pew. He did not go home with her any more for a while, and
      indeed visited her but seldom, anxious to avoid scandal, more especially
      as he was a deacon.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now that Charley was so far safe, Sara's cheek began to generate a
      little of that celestial rosy red which is the blossom of the woman-plant,
      although after all it hardly equalled the heart of the blush rose. She
      grew a little rounder in form too, for she lived rather better now,&mdash;buying
      herself a rasher of bacon twice a week. Hence she began to be in more
      danger, as any one acquainted with her surroundings will easily
      comprehend. But what seemed at first the ruin of her hopes dissipated this
      danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening, when she returned from her work, she found Stephen in her
      room. She made him the submissive grateful salutation, half courtesy, half
      bow, with which she always greeted him, and awaited his will.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am very sorry to have to tell you, Sara, that your brother&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned white as a shroud, and her great black eyes grew greater and
      blacker as she stared in agonized expectancy while Stephen hesitated in
      search of a better form of communication. Finding none, he blurted out the
      fact&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "&mdash;has robbed me, and run away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't send him to prison, Mr. Archer," shrieked Sara, and laid herself on
      the floor at his feet with a grovelling motion, as if striving with her
      mother earth for comfort. There was not a film of art in this. She had
      never been to a theatre. The natural urging of life gave the truest shape
      to her entreaty. Her posture was the result of the same feeling which made
      the nations of old bring their sacrifices to the altar of a deity who,
      possibly benevolent in the main, had yet cause to be inimical to them.
      From the prostrate living sacrifice arose the one prayer, "Don't send him
      to prison; don't send him to prison!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Stephen gazed at her in bewildered admiration, half divine and all human.
      A certain consciousness of power had, I confess, a part in his silence,
      but the only definite shape this consciousness took was of beneficence.
      Attributing his silence to unwillingness, Sara got half-way from the
      ground&mdash;that is, to her knees&mdash;and lifted a face of utter
      entreaty to the sight of Stephen. I will not say words fail me to describe
      the intensity of its prayer, for words fail me to describe the commonest
      phenomenon of nature: all I can is to say, that it made Stephen's heart
      too large for its confining walls. "Mr. Archer," she said, in a voice
      hollow with emotion, "I will do <i>anything</i> you like. I will be your
      slave. Don't send Charley to prison."
    </p>
    <p>
      The words were spoken with a certain strange dignity of self-abnegation.
      It is not alone the country people of Cumberland or of Scotland, who in
      their highest moments are capable of poetic utterance.
    </p>
    <p>
      An indescribable thrill of conscious delight shot through the frame of
      Stephen as the woman spoke the words. But the gentleman in him triumphed.
      I would have said <i>the Christian</i>, for whatever there was in Stephen
      of the <i>gentle</i> was there in virtue of the <i>Christian</i>, only he
      failed in one point: instead of saying at once, that he had no intention
      of prosecuting the boy, he pretended, I believe from the satanic delight
      in power that possesses every man of us, that he would turn it over in his
      mind. It might have been more dangerous, but it would have been more
      divine, if he had lifted the kneeling woman to his heart, and told her
      that not for the wealth of an imagination would he proceed against her
      brother. The divinity, however, was taking its course, both rough-hewing
      and shaping the ends of the two.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose from the ground, sat on the one chair, with her face to the wall,
      and wept, helplessly, with the added sting, perhaps, of a faint personal
      disappointment. Stephen failed to attract her notice, and left the room.
      She started up when she heard the door close, and flew to open it, but was
      only in time to hear the outer door. She sat down and cried again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stephen had gone to find the boy if he might, and bring him to his sister.
      He ought to have said so, for to permit suffering for the sake of a joyful
      surprise is not good. Going home first, he was hardly seated in his room,
      to turn over not the matter but the means, when a knock came to the
      shop-door, the sole entrance, and there were two policemen bringing the
      deserter in a cab. He had been run over in the very act of decamping with
      the contents of the till, had lain all but insensible at the hospital
      while his broken leg was being set, but, as soon as he came to himself,
      had gone into such a fury of determination to return to his master, that
      the house-surgeon saw that the only chance for the ungovernable creature
      was to yield. Perhaps he had some dim idea of restoring the money ere his
      master should have discovered its loss. As he was very little, they made a
      couch for him in the cab, and so sent him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would appear that the suffering and the faintness had given his
      conscience a chance of being heard. The accident was to Charley what the
      sight of the mountain-peak was to the boy Wordsworth. He was delirious
      when he arrived, and instead of showing any contrition towards his master,
      only testified an extravagant joy at finding him again. Stephen had him
      taken into the back room, and laid upon his own bed. One of the policemen
      fetched the charwoman, and when she arrived, Stephen went to find Sara.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was sitting almost as he had left her, with a dull, hopeless look.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sorry to say Charley has had an accident," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She started up and clasped her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is not in prison?" she panted in a husky voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; he is at my house. Come and see him. I don't think he is in any
      danger, but his leg is broken."
    </p>
    <p>
      A gleam of joy crossed Sara's countenance. She did not mind the broken
      leg, for he was safe from her terror. She put on her bonnet, tied the
      strings with trembling hands, and went with Stephen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see God wants to keep him out of prison too," he said, as they walked
      along the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to Sara this hardly conveyed an idea. She walked by his side in
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Charley! Charley!" she cried, when she saw him white on the bed, rolling
      his head from side to side. Charley ordered her away with words awful to
      hear, but which from him meant no more than words of ordinary temper in
      the mouth of the well-nurtured man or woman. She had spoiled and indulged
      him all his life, and now for the first time she was nothing to him, while
      the master who had lectured and restrained him was everything. When the
      surgeon wanted to change his dressings, he would not let him touch them
      till his master came. Before he was able to leave his bed, he had
      developed for Stephen a terrier-like attachment. But, after the first
      feverishness was over, his sister waited upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stephen got a lodging, and abandoned his back room to the brother and
      sister. But he had to attend to his shop, and therefore saw much of both
      of them. Finding then to his astonishment that Sara could not read, he
      gave all his odd moments to her instruction, and her mind being at rest
      about Charley so long as she had him in bed, her spirit had leisure to
      think of other things.
    </p>
    <p>
      She learned rapidly. The lesson-book was of course the New Testament; and
      Stephen soon discovered that Sara's questions, moving his pity at first
      because of the ignorance they displayed, always left him thinking about
      some point that had never occurred to him before; so that at length he
      regarded Sara as a being of superior intelligence waylaid and obstructed
      by unfriendly powers upon her path towards the threshold of the kingdom,
      while she looked up to him as to one supreme in knowledge as in goodness.
      But she never could understand the pastor. This would have been a great
      trouble to Stephen, had not his vanity been flattered by her understanding
      of himself. He did not consider that growing love had enlightened his eyes
      to see into her heart, and enabled him thus to use an ordinary human
      language for the embodiment of common-sense ideas; whereas the speech of
      the pastor contained such an admixture of technicalities as to be
      unintelligible to the neophyte.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stephen was now distressed to find that whereas formerly he had received
      everything without question that his minister spoke, he now in general
      went home in a doubting, questioning mood, begotten of asking himself what
      Sara would say. He feared at first that the old Adam was beginning to get
      the upper hand of him, and that Satan was laying snares for his soul. But
      when he found at the same time that his conscience was growing more
      scrupulous concerning his business affairs, his hope sprouted afresh.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, after Charley had been out for the first time, Sara, with a
      little tremor of voice and manner, addressed Stephen thus:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall take Charley home to-morrow, if you please, Mr. Archer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't mean to say, Sara, you've been paying for those lodgings all
      this time?" half-asked, half-exclaimed Stephen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Mr. Archer. We, must have somewhere to go to. It ain't easy to get a
      room at any moment, now them railways is everywheres."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I hope as how you're comfortable where you are, Sara?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Mr. Archer. But what am I to do for all your kindness?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can pay me all in a lump, if you like, Sara. Only you don't owe me
      nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her colour came and went. She was not used to men. She could not tell what
      he would have her understand, and could not help trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean, Mr. Archer?" she faltered out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean you can give me yourself, Sara, and that'll clear all scores."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Mr. Archer&mdash;you've been a-teaching of me good things&mdash;You
      <i>don't</i> mean to marry me!" exclaimed Sara, bursting into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course I do, Sara. Don't cry about it. I won't if you don't like."

      CHAPTER I.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "My hearers, we grow old," said the preacher. "Be it summer or be it
      spring with us now, autumn will soon settle down into winter, that winter
      whose snow melts only in the grave. The wind of the world sets for the
      tomb. Some of us rejoice to be swept along on its swift wings, and hear it
      bellowing in the hollows of earth and sky; but it will grow a terror to
      the man of trembling limb and withered brain, until at length he will long
      for the shelter of the tomb to escape its roaring and buffeting. Happy the
      man who shall then be able to believe that old age itself, with its
      pitiable decays and sad dreams of youth, is the chastening of the Lord, a
      sure sign of his love and his fatherhood."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the first Sunday in Advent; but "the chastening of the Lord" came
      into almost every sermon that man preached.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eloquent! But after all, <i>can</i> this kind of thing be true?" said to
      himself a man of about thirty, who sat decorously listening. For many
      years he had thought he believed this kind of thing&mdash;but of late he
      was not so sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beside him sat his wife, in her new winter bonnet, her pretty face turned
      up toward the preacher; but her eyes&mdash;nothing else&mdash;revealed
      that she was not listening. She was much younger than her husband&mdash;hardly
      twenty, indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the upper corner of the pew sat a pale-faced child about five, sucking
      her thumb, and staring at the preacher.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sermon over, they walked home in proximity. The husband looked gloomy,
      and his eyes sought the ground. The wife looked more smiling than
      cheerful, and her pretty eyes went hither and thither. Behind them walked
      the child&mdash;steadily, "with level-fronting eyelids."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a late-built region of large, common-place houses, and at one of
      them they stopped and entered. The door of the dining-room was open,
      showing the table laid for their Sunday dinner. The gentleman passed on to
      the library behind it, the lady went up to her bedroom, and the child a
      stage higher to the nursery.
    </p>
    <p>
      It wanted half an hour to dinner. Mr. Greatorex sat down, drummed with his
      fingers on the arm of his easy-chair, took up a book of arctic
      exploration, threw it again on the table, got up, and went to the
      smoking-room. He had built it for his wife's sake, but was often glad of
      it for his own. Again he seated himself, took a cigar, and smoked
      gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having reached her bedroom, Mrs. Greatorex took off her bonnet, and stood
      for ten minutes turning it round and round. Earnestly she regarded it&mdash;now
      gave a twist to the wire-stem of a flower, then spread wider the loop of a
      bow. She was meditating what it lacked of perfection rather than brooding
      over its merits: she was keen in bonnets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Sophy&mdash;or, as she called herself by a transposition of
      consonant sounds common with children, Phosy&mdash;found her nurse Alice
      in the nursery. But she was lost in the pages of a certain London weekly,
      which had found her in a mood open to its influences, and did not even
      look up when the child entered. With some effort Phosy drew off her
      gloves, and with more difficulty untied her hat. Then she took off her
      jacket, smoothed her hair, and retreated to a corner. There a large shabby
      doll lay upon her little chair: she took it up, disposed it gently upon
      the bed, seated herself in its place, got a little book from where she had
      left it under the chair, smoothed down her skirts, and began
      simultaneously to read and suck her thumb. The book was an unhealthy one,
      a cup filled to the brim with a poverty-stricken and selfish religion:
      such are always breaking out like an eruption here and there over the body
      of the Church, doing their part, doubtless, in carrying off the evil
      humours generated by poverty of blood, or the congestion of
      self-preservation. It is wonderful out of what spoiled fruit some children
      will suck sweetness.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she did not read far: her thoughts went back to a phrase which had
      haunted her ever since first she went to church: "Whom the Lord loveth, he
      chasteneth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish he would chasten me," she thought for the hundredth time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The small Christian had no suspicion that her whole life had been a period
      of chastening&mdash;that few children indeed had to live in such a sunless
      atmosphere as hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice threw down the newspaper, gazed from the window into the back-yard
      of the next house, saw nothing but an elderly man-servant brushing a
      garment, and turned upon Sophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why don't you hang up your jacket, miss?" she said, sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little one rose, opened the wardrobe-door wide, carried a chair to it,
      fetched her jacket from the bed, clambered up on the chair, and, leaning
      far forward to reach a peg, tumbled right into the bottom of the wardrobe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You clumsy!" exclaimed the nurse angrily, and pulling her out by the arm,
      shook her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice was not generally rough to her, but there were reasons to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phosy crept back to her seat, pale, frightened, and a little hurt. Alice
      hung up the jacket, closed the wardrobe, and, turning, contemplated her
      own pretty face and neat figure in the glass opposite. The dinner-bell
      rang.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There, I declare!" she cried, and wheeled round on Phosy. "And your hair
      not brushed yet, miss! Will you ever learn to do a thing without being
      told it? Thank goodness, I shan't be plagued with you long! But I pity her
      as comes after me: I do!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If the Lord would but chasten me!" said the child to herself, as she rose
      and laid down her book with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      The maid seized her roughly by the arm, and brushed her hair with an angry
      haste that made the child's eyes water, and herself feel a little ashamed
      at the sight of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How could anybody love such a troublesome chit?" she said, seeking the
      comfort of justification from the child herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another sigh was the poor little damsel's only answer. She looked very
      white and solemn as she entered the dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Greatorex was a merchant in the City. But he was more of a man than a
      merchant, which all merchants are not. Also, he was more scrupulous in his
      dealings than some merchants in the same line of business, who yet stood
      as well with the world as he; but, on the other hand, he had the meanness
      to pride himself upon it as if it had been something he might have done
      without and yet held up his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some six years before, he had married to please his parents; and a year
      before, he had married to please himself. His first wife had intellect,
      education, and heart, but little individuality&mdash;not enough to reflect
      the individuality of her husband. The consequence was, he found her
      uninteresting. He was kind and indulgent however, and not even her best
      friend blamed him much for manifesting nothing beyond the average devotion
      of husbands. But in truth his wife had great capabilities, only they had
      never ripened, and when she died, a fortnight after giving birth to Sophy,
      her husband had not a suspicion of the large amount of undeveloped power
      that had passed away with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her child was so like her both in countenance and manner that he was too
      constantly reminded of her unlamented mother; and he loved neither enough
      to discover that, in a sense as true as marvellous, the child was the very
      flower-bud of her mother's nature, in which her retarded blossom had yet a
      chance of being slowly carried to perfection. Love alone gives insight,
      and the father took her merely for a miniature edition of the volume which
      he seemed to have laid aside for ever in the dust of the earth's
      lumber-room. Instead, therefore, of watering the roots of his little human
      slip from the well of his affections, he had scarcely as yet perceived
      more in relation to her than that he was legally accountable for her
      existence, and bound to give her shelter and food. If he had questioned
      himself on the matter, he would have replied that love was not wanting,
      only waiting upon her growth, and the development of something to interest
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little right as he had had to expect anything from his first marriage, he
      had yet cherished some hopes therein&mdash;tolerably vague, it is true,
      yet hardly faint enough, it would seem, for he was disappointed in them.
      When its bonds fell from him, however, he flattered himself that he had
      not worn them in vain, but had through them arrived at a knowledge of
      women as rare as profound. But whatever the reach of this knowledge, it
      was not sufficient to prevent him from harbouring the presumptuous hope of
      so choosing and so fashioning the heart and mind of a woman that they
      should be as concave mirrors to his own. I do not mean that he would have
      admitted the figure, but such was really the end he blindly sought. I
      wonder how many of those who have been disappointed in such an attempt
      have been thereby aroused to the perception of what a frightful failure
      their success would have been on both sides. It was bad enough that
      Augustus Greatorex's theories had cramped his own development; it would
      have been ten-fold worse had they been operative to the stunting of
      another soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Letty Merewether was the daughter of a bishop <i>in partibus</i>. She had
      been born tolerably innocent, had grown up more than tolerably pretty, and
      was, when she came to England at the age of sixteen, as nearly a genuine
      example of Locke's sheet of white paper as could well have fallen to the
      hand of such an experimenter as Greatorex would fain become.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his suit he had prospered&mdash;perhaps too easily. He loved the girl,
      or at least loved the modified reflection of her in his own mind; while
      she, thoroughly admiring the dignity, good looks, and accomplishments of
      the man whose attentions flattered her self-opinion, accorded him
      deference enough to encourage his vainest hopes. Although she knew little,
      fluttering over the merest surfaces of existence, she had sense enough to
      know that he talked sense to her, and foolishness enough to put it down to
      her own credit, while for the sense itself she cared little or nothing.
      And Greatorex, without even knowing what she was rough-hewn for, would
      take upon him to shape her ends!&mdash;an ambition the Divinity never
      permits to succeed: he who fancies himself the carver finds himself but
      the chisel, or indeed perhaps only the mallet, in the hand of the true
      workman.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the days of his courtship, then, Letty listened and smiled, or
      answered with what he took for a spiritual response, when it was merely a
      brain-echo. Looking down into the pond of her being, whose surface was,
      not yet ruffled by any bubbling of springs from below, he saw the
      reflection of himself and was satisfied. An able man on his hobby looks a
      centaur of wisdom and folly; but if he be at all a wise man, the beast
      will one day or other show him the jade's favour of unseating him.
      Meantime Augustus Greatorex was fooled, not by poor little Letty, who was
      not capable of fooling him, but by himself. Letty had made no pretences;
      had been interested, and had shown her interest; had understood, or seemed
      to understand, what he said to her, and forgotten it the next moment&mdash;had
      no pocket to put it in, did not know what to do with it, and let it drop
      into the Limbo of Vanity. They had not been married many days before the
      scouts of advancing disappointment were upon them. Augustus resisted
      manfully for a time. But the truth was each of the two had to become a
      great deal more than either was, before any approach to unity was
      possible. He tried to interest her in one subject after another&mdash;tried
      her first, I am ashamed to say, with political economy. In that instance,
      when he came home to dinner he found that she had not got beyond the first
      page of the book he had left with her. But she had the best of excuses,
      namely, that of that page she had not understood a sentence. He saw his
      mistake, and tried her with poetry. But Milton, with whom unfortunately he
      commenced his approaches, was to her, if not equally unintelligible,
      equally uninteresting. He tried her next with the elements of science, but
      with no better success. He returned to poetry, and read some of the Faerie
      Queene with her: she was, or seemed to be, interested in all his talk
      about it, and inclined to go on with it in his absence, but found the
      first stanza she tried more than enough without him to give life to it.
      She could give it none, and therefore it gave her none. I believe she read
      a chapter of the Bible every day, but the only books she read with any
      real interest were novels of a sort that Augustus despised. It never
      occurred to him that he ought at once to have made friends of this Momus
      of unrighteousness, for by them he might have found entrance to the sealed
      chamber. He ought to have read with her the books she did like, for by
      them only could he make her think, and from them alone could he lead her
      to better. It is but from the very step upon which one stands that one can
      move to the next. Besides these books, there was nothing in her scheme of
      the universe but fashion, dress, calls, the park, other-peopledom,
      concerts, plays, churchgoing&mdash;whatever could show itself on the
      frosted glass of her <i>camera obscura</i>&mdash;make an interest of
      motion and colour in her darkened chamber. Without these, her bosom's
      mistress would have found life unendurable, for not yet had she ascended
      her throne, but lay on the floor of her nursery, surrounded with toys that
      imitated life.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was no wonder, therefore, that Augustus was at length compelled to
      allow himself disappointed. That it was the fault of his self-confidence
      made the thing no whit better. He was too much of a man not to cherish a
      certain tenderness for her, but he soon found to his dismay that it had
      begun to be mingled with a shadow of contempt. Against this he struggled,
      but with fluctuating success. He stopped later and later at business, and
      when he came home spent more and more of his time in the smoking-room,
      where by and by he had bookshelves put up. Occasionally he would accept an
      invitation to dinner and accompany his wife, but he detested evening
      parties, and when Letty, who never refused an invitation if she could help
      it, went to one, he remained at home with his books. But his power of
      reading began to diminish. He became restless and irritable. Something
      kept gnawing at his heart. There was a sore spot in it. The spot grew
      larger and larger, and by degrees the centre of his consciousness came to
      be a soreness: his cherished idea had been fooled; he had taken a silly
      girl for a woman of undeveloped wealth;&mdash;a bubble, a surface whereon
      fair colours chased each other, for a hearted crystal.
    </p>
    <p>
      On her part, Letty too had her grief, which, unlike Augustus, she did not
      keep to herself, receiving in return from more than one of her friends the
      soothing assurance that Augustus was only like all other men; that women
      were but their toys, which they cast away when weary of them. Letty did
      not see that she was herself making a toy of her life, or that Augustus
      was right in refusing to play with such a costly and delicate thing.
      Neither did Augustus see that, having, by his own blunder, married a mere
      child, he was bound to deal with her as one, and not let the child suffer
      for his fault more than what could not be helped. It is not by pressing
      our insights upon them, but by bathing the sealed eyelids of the human
      kittens, that we can help them.
    </p>
    <p>
      And all the time poor little Phosy was left to the care of Alice, a
      clever, careless, good-hearted, self-satisfied damsel, who, although
      seldom so rough in her behaviour as we have just seen her, abandoned the
      child almost entirely to her own resources. It was often she sat alone in
      the nursery, wishing the Lord would chasten her&mdash;because then he
      would love her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first course was nearly over ere Augustus had brought himself to ask&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did you think of the sermon to-day, Letty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not much," answered Letty. "I am not fond of finery. I prefer
      simplicity."
    </p>
    <p>
      Augustus held his peace bitterly. For it was just finery in a sermon,
      without knowing it, that Letty was fond of: what seemed to him a flimsy
      syllabub of sacred things, beaten up with the whisk of composition, was
      charming to Letty; while, on the contrary, if a man such as they had been
      listening to was carried away by the thoughts that struggled in him for
      utterance, the result, to her judgment, was finery, and the object
      display. In excuse it must be remembered that she had been used to her
      father's style, which no one could have aspersed with lack of sobriety.
      Presently she spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gus, dear, couldn't you make up your mind for once to go with me to Lady
      Ashdaile's to-morrow? I am getting quite ashamed of appearing so often
      without you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is another way of avoiding that unpleasantness," remarked her
      husband drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You cruel creature!" returned Letty playfully. "But I must go this once,
      for I promised Mrs. Holden."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know, Letty," said her husband, after a little pause, "it gets of
      more and more consequence that you should not fatigue yourself. By keeping
      such late hours in such stifling rooms you are endangering two lives&mdash;remember
      that, Letty. It you stay at home to-morrow, I will come home early, and
      read to you all the evening."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gussy, that <i>would</i> be charming. You <i>know</i> there is nothing in
      the world I should enjoy so much. But this time I really mustn't."
    </p>
    <p>
      She launched into a list of all the great nobodies and small somebodies
      who were to be there, and whom she positively must see: it might be her
      only chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those last words quenched a sarcasm on Augustus' lips. He was kinder than
      usual the rest of the evening, and read her to sleep with the Pilgrim's
      Progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phosy sat in a corner, listened, and understood. Or where she
      misunderstood, it was an honest misunderstanding, which never does much
      hurt. Neither father nor mother spoke to her till they bade her good
      night. Neither saw the hungry heart under the mask of the still face. The
      father never imagined her already fit for the modelling she was better
      without, and the stepmother had to become a mother before she could value
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phosy went to bed to dream of the Valley of Humiliation.

      CHAPTER II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next morning Alice gave her mistress warning. It was quite unexpected,
      and she looked at her aghast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alice," she said at length, "you're never going to leave me at such a
      time!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry it don't suit you, ma'am, but I must."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Alice? What is the matter? Has Sophy been troublesome?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, ma'am; there's no harm in that child."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then what can it be, Alice? Perhaps you are going to be married sooner
      than you expected?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice gave her chin a little toss, pressed her lips together, and was
      silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have always been kind to you," resumed her mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sure, ma'am, I never made no complaints!" returned Alice, but as she
      spoke she drew herself up straighter than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then what is it?" said her mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The fact is, ma'am," answered the girl, almost fiercely, "I <i>cannot</i>
      any longer endure a state of domestic slavery."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't understand you a bit better," said Mrs. Greatorex, trying, but in
      vain, to smile, and therefore looking angrier than she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean, ma'am&mdash;an' I see no reason as I shouldn't say it, for it's
      the truth&mdash;there's a worm at the root of society where one yuman
      bein' 's got to do the dirty work of another. I don't mind sweepin' up my
      own dust, but I won't sweep up nobody else's. I ain't a goin' to demean
      myself no longer! There!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leave the room, Alice," said Mrs. Greatorex; and when, with a toss and a
      flounce, the young woman had vanished, she burst into tears of anger and
      annoyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day passed. The evening came. She dressed without Alice's usual help,
      and went to Lady Ashdaile's with her friend. There a reaction took place,
      and her spirits rose unnaturally. She even danced&mdash;to the disgust of
      one or two quick-eyed matrons who sat by the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she came home she found her husband sitting up for her. He said next
      to nothing, and sat up an hour longer with his book.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the night she was taken ill. Her husband called Alice, and ran himself
      to fetch the doctor. For some hours she seemed in danger, but by noon was
      much better. Only the greatest care was necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as she could speak, she told Augustus of Alice's warning, and he
      sent for her to the library.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood before him with flushed cheeks and flashing eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I understand, Alice, you have given your mistress warning," he said
      gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your mistress is very ill, Alice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you think it would be ungrateful of you to leave her in her present
      condition? She's not likely to be strong for some time to come."
    </p>
    <p>
      The use of the word "ungrateful" was an unfortunate one. Alice begged to
      know what she had to be grateful for. Was her work worth nothing? And her
      master, as every one must who claims that which can only be freely given,
      found himself in the wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Alice," he said, "we won't dispute that point; and if you are
      really determined on going, you must do the best you can for your mistress
      for the rest of the month."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice's sense of injury was soothed by her master's forbearance. She had
      always rather approved of Mr. Greatorex, and she left the room more softly
      than she had entered it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Letty had a fortnight in bed, during which she reflected a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      The very day on which she left her room, Alice sought an interview with
      her master, and declared she could not stay out her month; she must go
      home at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been very attentive to her mistress during the fortnight: there
      must be something to account for her strange behaviour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come now, Alice," said her master, "what's at the back of all this? You
      have been a good, well-behaved, obliging girl till now, and I am certain
      you would never be like this if there weren't something wrong somewhere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Something wrong, sir! No, indeed, sir! Except you call it wrong to have
      an old uncle 's dies and leaves ever so much money&mdash;thousands on
      thousands, the lawyers say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And does it come to you then, Alice?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I get my share, sir. He left it to be parted even between his nephews and
      nieces."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Alice, you are quite an heiress, then!" returned her master,
      scarcely however believing the thing so grand as Alice would have it. "But
      don't you think now it would be rather hard that your fortune should be
      Mrs. Greatorex's misfortune?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I don't see as how it shouldn't," replied Alice. "It's mis'ess's
      fortun' as 'as been my misfortun'&mdash;ain't it now, sir? An' why
      shouldn't it be the other way next?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't quite see how your mistress's fortune can be said to be your
      misfortune, Alice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anybody would see that, sir, as wasn't blinded by class-prejudices."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Class-prejudices!" exclaimed Mr. Greatorex, in surprise at the word.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a term they use, I believe, sir! But it's plain enough that if
      mis'ess hadn't 'a' been better off than me, she wouldn't ha' been able to
      secure my services&mdash;as you calls it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is certainly plain enough," returned Mr. Greatorex. "But suppose
      nobody had been able to secure your services, what would have become of
      you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By that time the people'd have rose to assert their rights."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To what?&mdash;To fortunes like yours?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To bread and cheese at least, sir," returned Alice, pertly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, but you've had something better than bread and cheese."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't make no complaints as to the style of livin' in the house, sir,
      but that's all one, so long as it's on the vile condition of domestic
      slavery&mdash;which it's nothing can justify."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then of course, although you are now a woman of property, you will never
      dream of having any one to wait on you," said her master, amused with the
      volume of human nature thus opened to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All I say, sir, is&mdash;it's my turn now; and I ain't goin' to be sit
      upon by no one. I know my dooty to myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't know there was such a duty, Alice," said her master.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something in his tone displeased her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you know now, sir," she said, and bounced out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next moment, however, ashamed of her rudeness, she re-entered, saying,
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't want to be unkind, sir, but I must go home. I've got a brother
      that's ill, too, and wants to see me. If you don't object to me goin' home
      for a month, I promise you to come back and see mis'ess through her
      trouble&mdash;as a friend, you know, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But just listen to me first, Alice," said Mr. Greatorex. "I've had
      something to do with wills in my time, and I can assure you it is not
      likely to be less than a year before you can touch the money. You had much
      better stay where you are till your uncle's affairs are settled. You don't
      know what may happen. There's many a slip between cup and lip, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! it's all right, sir. Everybody knows the money's left to his nephews
      and nieces, and me and my brother's as good as any."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't doubt it: still, if you'll take my advice, you'll keep a sound
      roof over your head till another's ready for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice only threw her chin in the air, and said almost threateningly,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Am I to go for the month, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll talk to your mistress about it," answered Mr. Greatorex, not at all
      sure that such an arrangement would be for his wife's comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the next day Mrs. Greatorex had a long talk with Alice, and the result
      was that on the following Monday she was to go home for a month, and then
      return for two months more at least. What Mr. Greatorex had said about the
      legacy, had had its effect, and, besides, her mistress had spoken to her
      with pleasure in her good fortune. About Sophy no one felt any anxiety:
      she was no trouble to any one, and the housemaid would see to her.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the Sunday evening, Alice's lover, having heard, not from herself, but
      by a side wind, that she was going home the next day, made his appearance
      in Wimborne Square, somewhat perplexed&mdash;both at the move, and at her
      leaving him in ignorance of the same. He was a cabinet-maker in an honest
      shop in the neighbourhood, and in education, faculty, and general worth,
      considerably Alice's superior&mdash;a fact which had hitherto rather
      pleased her, but now gave zest to the change which she imagined had
      subverted their former relation. Full of the sense of her new superiority,
      she met him draped in an indescribable strangeness. John Jephson felt, at
      the very first word, as if her voice came from the other side of the
      English Channel. He wondered what he had done, or rather what Alice could
      imagine he had done or said, to put her in such tantrums.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alice, my dear," he said&mdash;for John was a man to go straight at the
      enemy, "what's amiss? What's come over you? You ain't altogether like your
      own self to-night! And here I find you're goin' away, and ne'er a word to
      me about it! What have I done?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice's chin alone made reply. She waited the fitting moment, with
      splendour to astonish, and with grandeur to subdue her lover. To tell the
      sad truth, she was no longer sure that it would be well to encourage him
      on the old footing; was she not standing on tiptoe, her skirts in her
      hand, on the brink of the brook that parted serfdom from gentility, on the
      point of stepping daintily across, and leaving domestic slavery, red
      hands, caps, and obedience behind her? How then was she to marry a man
      that had black nails, and smelt of glue? It was incumbent on her at least,
      for propriety's sake, to render him at once aware that it was in
      condescension ineffable she took any notice of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alice, my girl!" began John again, in expostulatory tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Cox, if you please, John Jephson," interposed Alice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What on 'arth's come over you?" exclaimed John, with the first throb of
      rousing indignation. "But if you ain't your own self no more, why, Miss
      Cox be it. 'T seems to me 's if I warn't my own self no more&mdash;'s if
      I'd got into some un else, or 't least hedn't got my own ears on m' own
      head.&mdash;Never saw or heerd Alice like this afore!" he added, turning
      in gloomy bewilderment to the housemaid for a word of human sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The movement did not altogether please Alice, and she felt she must
      justify her behaviour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see, John," she said, with dignity, keeping her back towards him, and
      pretending to dust the globe of a lamp, "there's things as no woman can
      help, and therefore as no man has no right to complain of them. It's not
      as if I'd gone an' done it, or changed myself, no more 'n if it 'ad took
      place in my cradle. What can I help it, if the world goes and changes
      itself? Am <i>I</i> to blame?&mdash;tell me that. It's not that. I make no
      complaint, but I tell you it ain't me, it's circumstances as is gone and
      changed theirselves, and bein' as circumstances is changed, things ain't
      the same as they was, and Miss is the properer term from you to me, John
      Jephson."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dang it if I know what you're a drivin' at, Alice!&mdash;Miss Cox!&mdash;and
      I beg yer pardon, miss, I'm sure.&mdash;Dang me if I do!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't swear, John Jephson&mdash;leastways before a lady. It's not
      proper."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It seems to me, Miss Cox, as if the wind was a settin' from Bedlam, or
      may be Colney Hatch," said John, who was considered a humourist among his
      comrades. "I wouldn't take no liberties with a lady, Miss Cox; but if I
      might be so bold as to arst the joke of the thing&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Joke, indeed!" cried Alice. "Do you call a dead uncle and ten thousand
      pounds a joke?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "God bless me!" said John. "You don't mean it, Alice?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do mean it, and that you'll find, John Jephson. I'm goin' to bid you
      good-bye to-morrer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whoy, Alice!" exclaimed honest John, aghast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's truth I tell ye," said Alice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And for how long?" gasped John, fore-feeling illimitable misfortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That depends," returned Alice, who did not care to lessen the effect of
      her communication by mentioning her promised return for a season. "&mdash;It
      ain't likely," she added, "as a heiress is a goin' to act the nuss-maid
      much longer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But Alice," said John, "you don't mean to say&mdash;it's not in your mind
      now&mdash;it can't be, Alice&mdash;you're only jokin' with me&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, and I'm not!" interjected Alice, with a sniff.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't mean that way, you know. What I mean is, you don't mean as how
      this 'ere money&mdash;dang it all!&mdash;as how it's to be all over
      between you and me?&mdash;You <i>can't</i> mean that, Alice!" ended the
      poor fellow, with a choking in his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was very hard upon him! He must either look as if he wanted to share
      her money, or else as if he were ready to give her up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Arst yourself, John Jephson," answered Alice, "whether it's likely a
      young lady of fortun' would be keepin' company with a young man as didn't
      know how to take off his hat to her in the park?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice did not above half mean what she said: she wished mainly to enhance
      her own importance. At the same time she did mean it half, and that would
      have been enough for Jephson. He rose, grievously wounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-bye, Alice," he said, taking the hand she did not refuse. "Ye're
      throwin' from ye what all yer money won't buy."
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave a scornful little laugh, and John walked out of the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the door he turned with one lingering look; but in Alice there was no
      sign of softening. She turned scornfully away, and no doubt enjoyed her
      triumph to the full.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning she went away.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Greatorex had ceased to regard the advent of Christmas with much
      interest. Naturally gifted with a strong religious tendency, he had, since
      his first marriage, taken, not to denial, but to the side of objection,
      spending much energy in contempt for the foolish opinions of others, a
      self-indulgence which does less than little to further the growth of one's
      own spirit in truth and righteousness. The only person who stands excused&mdash;I
      do not say justified&mdash;in so doing, is the man who, having been taught
      the same opinions, has found them a legion of adversaries barring his way
      to the truth. But having got rid of them for himself, it is, I suspect,
      worse than useless to attack them again, save as the ally of those who are
      fighting their way through the same ranks to the truth. Greatorex had been
      indulging his intellect at the expense of his heart. A man may have light
      in the brain and darkness in the heart. It were better to be an owl than a
      strong-eyed apteryx. He was on the path which naturally ends in blindness
      and unbelief. I fancy, if he had not been neglectful of his child, she
      would ere this time have relighted his Christmas-candles for him; but now
      his second disappointment in marriage had so dulled his heart that he had
      begun to regard life as a stupid affair, in which the most enviable fool
      was the man who could still expect to realize an ideal. He had set out on
      a false track altogether, but had not yet discovered that there had been
      an immoral element at work in his mistake.
    </p>
    <p>
      For what right had he to desire the fashioning of any woman after his
      ideas? did not the angel of her eternal Ideal for ever behold the face of
      her Father in heaven? The best that can be said for him is, that,
      notwithstanding his disappointment and her faults, yea, notwithstanding
      his own faults, which were, with all his cultivation and strength of
      character, yet more serious than hers, he was still kind to her; yes, I
      may say for him, that, notwithstanding even her silliness, which is a
      sickening fault, and one which no supremacy of beauty can overshadow, he
      still loved her a little. Hence the care he showed for her in respect of
      the coming sorrow was genuine; it did not all belong to his desire for a
      son to whom he might be a father indeed&mdash;after his own fancies,
      however. Letty, on her part, was as full of expectation as the girl who
      has been promised a doll that can shut and open its eyes, and cry when it
      is pinched; her carelessness of its safe arrival came of ignorance and not
      indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      It cannot but seem strange that such a man should have been so careless of
      the child he had. But from the first she had painfully reminded him of her
      mother, with whom in truth he had never quarrelled, but with whom he had
      not found life the less irksome on that account. Add to this that he had
      been growing fonder of business,&mdash;a fact which indicated, in a man of
      his endowment and development, an inclination downwards of the plane of
      his life. It was some time since he had given up reading poetry. History
      had almost followed: he now read little except politics, travels, and
      popular expositions of scientific progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      That year Christmas Eve fell upon a Monday. The day before, Letty not
      feeling very well, her husband thought it better not to leave her, and
      gave up going to church. Phosy was utterly forgotten, but she dressed
      herself, and at the usual hour appeared with her prayer-book in her hand
      ready for church. When her father told her that he was not going, she
      looked so blank that he took pity upon her, and accompanied her to the
      church-door, promising to meet her as she came out. Phosy sighed from
      relief as she entered, for she had a vague idea that by going to church to
      pray for it she might move the Lord to chasten her. At least he would see
      her there, and might think of it. She had never had such an attention from
      her father before, never such dignity conferred upon her as to be allowed
      to appear in church alone, sitting in the pew by herself like a grown
      damsel. But I doubt if there was any pride in her stately step, or any
      vanity in the smile&mdash;no, not smile, but illuminated mist, the vapour
      of smiles, which haunted her sweet little solemn church-window of a face,
      as she walked up the aisle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The preacher was one of whom she had never heard her father speak
      slighting word, in whom her unbounded trust had never been shaken. Also he
      was one who believed with his whole soul in the things that make Christmas
      precious. To him the birth of the wonderful baby hinted at hundreds of
      strange things in the economy of the planet. That a man could so
      thoroughly persuade himself that, he believed the old fable, was matter of
      marvel to some of his friends who held blind Nature the eternal mother,
      and Night the everlasting grandmother of all things. But the child Phosy,
      in her dreams or out of them, in church or nursery, with her book or her
      doll, was never out of the region of wonders, and would have believed, or
      tried to believe, anything that did not involve a moral impossibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      What the preacher said I need not even partially repeat; it is enough to
      mention a certain metamorphosed deposit from the stream of his eloquence
      carried home in her mind by Phosy: from some of his sayings about the
      birth of Jesus into the world, into the family, into the individual human
      bosom, she had got it into her head that Christmas Day was not a birthday
      like that she had herself last year, but that, in some wonderful way, to
      her requiring no explanation, the baby Jesus was born every Christmas Day
      afresh. What became of him afterwards she did not know, and indeed she had
      never yet thought to ask how it was that he could come to every house in
      London as well as No. 1, Wimborne Square. Little of a home as another
      might think it, that house was yet to her the centre of all houses, and
      the wonder had not yet widened rippling beyond it: into that spot of the
      pool the eternal gift would fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father forgot the time over his book, but so entranced was her heart
      with the expectation of the promised visit, now so near&mdash;the day
      after to-morrow&mdash;that, if she did not altogether forget to look for
      him as she stepped down the stair from the church door to the street, his
      absence caused her no uneasiness; and when, just as she reached it, he
      opened the house-door in tardy haste to redeem his promise, she looked up
      at him with a solemn, smileless repose, born of spiritual tension and
      speechless anticipation, upon her face, and walking past him without
      change in the rhythm of her motion, marched stately up the stairs to the
      nursery. I believe the centre of her hope was that when the baby came she
      would beg him on her knees to ask the Lord to chasten her.
    </p>
    <p>
      When dessert was over, her mother on the sofa in the drawing-room, and her
      father in an easy-chair, with a bottle of his favourite wine by his side,
      she crept out of the room and away again to the nursery. There she reached
      up to her little bookshelf, and, full of the sermon as spongy mists are
      full of the sunlight, took thence a volume of stories from the German, the
      re-reading of one of which, narrating the visit of the Christ-child, laden
      with gifts, to a certain household, and what he gave to each and all
      therein, she had, although sorely tempted, saved up until now, and sat
      down with it by the fire, the only light she had. When the housemaid,
      suddenly remembering she must put her to bed, and at the same time
      discovering it was a whole hour past her usual time, hurried to the
      nursery, she found her fast asleep in her little armchair, her book on her
      lap, and the fire self-consumed into a dark cave with a sombre glow in its
      deepest hollows. Dreams had doubtless come to deepen the impressions of
      sermon and <i>mhrchen</i>, for as she slowly yielded to the hands of
      Polly putting her to bed, her lips, unconsciously moved of the slumbering
      but not sleeping spirit, more than once murmured the words <i>Lord loveth</i>
      and <i>chasteneth</i>. Right blessedly would I enter the dreams of such a
      child&mdash;revel in them, as a bee in the heavenly gulf of a
      cactus-flower.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V.
    </h2>
    <p>
      On Christmas Eve the church bells were ringing through the murky air of
      London, whose streets lay flaring and steaming below. The brightest of
      their constellations were the butchers' shops, with their shows of prize
      beef; around them, the eddies of the human tides were most confused and
      knotted. But the toy-shops were brilliant also. To Phosy they would have
      been the treasure-caves of the Christ-child&mdash;all mysteries, all with
      insides to them&mdash;boxes, and desks, and windmills, and dove-cots, and
      hens with chickens, and who could tell what all? In every one of those
      shops her eyes would have searched for the Christ-child, the giver of all
      their wealth. For to her he was everywhere that night&mdash;ubiquitous as
      the luminous mist that brooded all over London&mdash;of which, however,
      she saw nothing but the glow above the mews. John Jephson was out in the
      middle of all the show, drifting about in it: he saw nothing that had
      pleasure in it, his heart was so heavy. He never thought once of the
      Christ-child, or even of the Christ-man, as the giver of anything. Birth
      is the one standing promise-hope for the race, but for poor John this
      Christmas held no promise. With all his humour, he was one of those
      people, generally dull and slow&mdash;God grant me and mine such dullness
      and such sloth&mdash;who having once loved, cannot cease. During the
      fortnight he had scarce had a moment's ease from the sting of his Alice's
      treatment. The honest fellow's feelings were no study to himself; he knew
      nothing but the pleasure and the pain of them; but, I believe it was not
      mainly for himself that he was sorry. Like Othello, "the pity of it"
      haunted him: he had taken Alice for a downright girl, about whom there was
      and could be no mistake; and the first hot blast of prosperity had swept
      her away like a hectic leaf. What were all the shops dressed out in holly
      and mistletoe, what were all the rushing flaming gas-jets, what the
      fattest of prize-pigs to John, who could never more imagine a spare-rib on
      the table between Alice and him of a Sunday? His imagination ran on seeing
      her pass in her carriage, and drop him a nod of condescension as she swept
      noisily by him&mdash;trudging home weary from his work to his loveless
      fireside. <i>He</i> didn't want her money! Honestly, he would rather have
      her without than with money, for he now regarded it as an enemy, seeing
      what evil changes it could work. "There be some devil in it, sure!" he
      said to himself. True, he had never found any in his week's wages, but he
      did remember once finding the devil in a month's wages received in the
      lump.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he was thus thinking with himself, a carriage came suddenly from a side
      street into the crowd, and while he stared at it, thinking Alice might be
      sitting inside it while he was tramping the pavement alone, she passed him
      on the other side on foot&mdash;was actually pushed against him: he looked
      round, and saw a young woman, carrying a small bag, disappearing in the
      crowd. "There's an air of Alice about <i>her</i>" said John to himself,
      seeing her back only. But of course it couldn't be Alice; for her he must
      look in the carriages now! And what a fool he was: every young woman
      reminded him of the one he had lost! Perhaps if he was to call the next
      day&mdash;Polly was a good-natured creature&mdash;he might hear some news
      of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been a troubled fortnight with Mrs. Greatorex. She wished much that
      she could have talked to her husband more freely, but she had not learned
      to feel at home with him. Yet he had been kinder and more attentive than
      usual all the time, so much so that Letty thought with herself&mdash;if
      she gave him a boy, he would certainly return to his first devotion. She
      said <i>boy</i>, because any one might see he cared little for Phosy. She
      had never discovered that he was disappointed in herself, but, since her
      disregard of his wishes had brought evil upon her, she had begun to
      suspect that he had some ground for being dissatisfied with her. She never
      dreamed of his kindness as the effort of a conscientious nature to make
      the best of what could not now be otherwise helped. Her own poverty of
      spirit and lack of worth achieved, she knew as little of as she did of the
      riches of Michael the archangel. One must have begun to gather wisdom
      before he can see his own folly.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening she was seated alone in the drawing-room, her husband having
      left her to smoke his cigar, when the butler entered and informed her that
      Alice had returned, but was behaving so oddly that they did not know what
      to do with her. Asking wherein her oddness consisted, and learning that it
      was mostly in silence and tears, she was not sorry to gather that some
      disappointment had befallen her, and felt considerable curiosity to know
      what it was. She therefore told him to send her upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime Polly, the housemaid, seeing plainly enough from her return in
      the middle of her holiday, and from her utter dejection, that Alice's
      expectations had been frustrated, and cherishing no little resentment
      against her because of her <i>uppishness</i> on the first news of her good
      fortune, had been ungenerous enough to take her revenge in a way as
      stinging in effect as bitter in intention; for she loudly protested that
      no amount of such luck as she pretended to suppose in Alice's possession,
      would have induced <i>her</i> to behave herself so that a handsome honest
      fellow like John Jephson should be driven to despise her, and take up with
      her betters. When her mistress's message came, Alice was only too glad to
      find refuge from the kitchen in the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment she entered, she fell on her knees at the foot of the couch on
      which her mistress lay, covered her face with her hands, and sobbed
      grievously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was the change more remarkable in her bearing than in her person. She
      was pale and worn, and had a hunted look&mdash;was in fact a mere shadow
      of what she had been. For a time her mistress found it impossible to quiet
      her so as to draw from her her story: tears and sobs combined with
      repugnance to hold her silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, ma'am!" she burst out at length, wringing her hands, "how ever <i>can</i>
      I tell you? You will never speak to me again. Little did I think such a
      disgrace was waiting me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was no fault of yours if you were misinformed," said her mistress, "or
      that your uncle was not the rich man you fancied."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, ma'am, there was no mistake there! He was more than twice as rich as
      I fancied. If he had only died a beggar, and left things as they was!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then he didn't leave it to his nephews and nieces as they told you?&mdash;Well,
      there's no disgrace in that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! but he did, ma'am: that was all right; no mistake there either,
      ma'am.&mdash;And to think o' me behavin' as I did&mdash;to you and master
      as was so good to me! Who'll ever take any more notice of me now, after
      what has come out&mdash;as I'm sure I no more dreamed on than the child
      unborn!"
    </p>
    <p>
      An agonized burst of fresh weeping followed, and it was with prolonged
      difficulty, and by incessant questioning, that Mrs. Greatorex at length
      drew from her the following facts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Alice and her brother could receive the legacy to which they laid
      claim, it was necessary to produce certain documents, the absence of
      which, as of any proof to take their place, led to the unavoidable
      publication of a fact previously known only to a living few&mdash;namely,
      that the father and mother of Alice Hopwood had never been married, which
      fact deprived them of the smallest claim on the legacy, and fell like a
      millstone upon Alice and her pride. From the height of her miserable
      arrogance she fell prone&mdash;not merely hurled back into the lowly
      condition from which she had raised her head only to despise it with base
      unrighteousness, and to adopt and reassert the principles she had abhorred
      when they affected herself&mdash;not merely this, but, in her own judgment
      at least, no longer the respectable member of society she had hitherto
      been justified in supposing herself. The relation of her father and mother
      she felt overshadow her with a disgrace unfathomable&mdash;the more
      overwhelming that it cast her from the gates of the Paradise she had
      seemed on the point of entering: her fall she measured by the height of
      the social ambition she had cherished, and had seemed on the point of
      attaining. But it is not an evil that the devil's money, which this legacy
      had from the first proved to Alice, should turn to a hot cinder in the
      hand. Rarely had a more haughty spirit than hers gone before a fall, and
      rarely has the fall been more sudden or more abject. And the consciousness
      of the behaviour into which her false riches had seduced her, changed the
      whip of her chastisement into scorpions. Worst of all, she had insulted
      her lover as beneath her notice, and the next moment had found herself too
      vile for his. Judging by herself, in the injustice of bitter humiliation
      she imagined him scoffing with his mates at the base-born menial who would
      set up for a fine lady. But had she been more worthy of honest John, she
      would have understood him better. As it was, no really good fortune could
      have befallen her but such as now seemed to her the depth of evil fortune.
      Without humiliation to prepare the way for humility, she must have become
      capable of more and more baseness, until she lost all that makes life
      worth having.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mrs. Greatorex had given her what consolation she found handy, and at
      length dismissed her, the girl, unable to endure her own company, sought
      the nursery, where she caught Sophy in her arms and embraced her with
      fervour. Never in her life having been the object of any such display of
      feeling, Phosy was much astonished: when Alice had set her down and she
      had resumed her seat by the fireside, she went on staring for a while&mdash;and
      then a strange sort of miming ensued.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Phosy's habit&mdash;one less rare with children than may by most be
      imagined&mdash;to do what she could to enter into any state of mind whose
      shows were sufficiently marked for her observation. She sought to lay hold
      of the feeling that produced the expression: less than the reproduction of
      a similar condition in her own imaginative sensorium, subject to her
      leisurely examination, would in no case satisfy the little metaphysician.
      But what was indeed very odd was the means she took for arriving at the
      sympathetic knowledge she desired. As if she had been the most earnest
      student of dramatic expression through the facial muscles, she would sit
      watching the countenance of the object of her solicitude, all the time,
      with full consciousness, fashioning her own as nearly as she could into
      the lines and forms of the other: in proportion as she succeeded, the
      small psychologist imagined she felt in herself the condition that
      produced the phenomenon she observed&mdash;as if the shape of her face
      cast inward its shadow upon her mind, and so revealed to it, through the
      two faces, what was moving and shaping in the mind of the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the present instance, having at length, after modelling and remodelling
      her face like that of a gutta-percha doll for some time, composed it
      finally into the best correspondence she could effect, she sat brooding
      for a while, with Alice's expression as it were frozen upon it. Gradually
      the forms assumed melted away, and allowed her still, solemn face to look
      out from behind them. The moment this evanishment was complete, she rose
      and went to Alice, where she sat staring into the fire, unconscious of the
      scrutiny she had been undergoing, and, looking up in her face, took her
      thumb out of her mouth, and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is the Lord chastening Alice? I wish he would chasten Phosy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face was calm as that of the Sphinx; there was no mist in the depth of
      her gray eyes, not a cloud on the wide heaven of her forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was the child crazed? What could the atom mean, with her big eyes looking
      right into her? Alice never had understood her: it were indeed strange if
      the less should comprehend the greater! She was not yet, capable of
      recognising the word of the Lord in the mouth of babes and sucklings. But
      there was a something in Phosy's face besides its calmness and
      unintelligibility. What it was Alice could never have told&mdash;yet it
      did her good. She lifted the child on her lap. There she soon fell asleep.
      Alice undressed her, laid her in her crib, and went to bed herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, weary as she was, she had to rise again before she got to sleep. Her
      mistress was again taken ill. Doctor and nurse were sent for in hot haste;
      hansom cabs came and went throughout the night, like noisy moths to the
      one lighted house in the street; there were soft steps within, and doors
      were gently opened and shut. The waters of Mara had risen and filled the
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards morning they were ebbing slowly away. Letty did not know that her
      husband was watching by her bedside. The street was quiet now. So was the
      house. Most of its people had been up throughout the night, but now they
      had all gone to bed except the strange nurse and Mr. Greatorex.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the morning of Christmas Day, and little Phosy knew it in every
      cranny of her soul. She was not of those who had been up all night, and
      now she was awake, early and wide, and the moment she awoke she was
      speculating: He was coming to-day&mdash;<i>how</i> would he come? Where
      should she find the baby Jesus? And when would he come? In the morning, or
      the afternoon, or in the evening? Could such a grief be in store for her
      as that he would not appear until night, when she would be again in bed?
      But she would not sleep till all hope was gone. Would everybody be
      gathered to meet him, or would he show himself to one after another, each
      alone? Then her turn would be last, and oh, if he would come to the
      nursery! But perhaps he would not appear to her at all!&mdash;for was she
      not one whom the Lord did not care to chasten?
    </p>
    <p>
      Expectation grew and wrought in her until she could lie in bed no longer.
      Alice was fast asleep. It must be early, but whether it was yet light or
      not she could not tell for the curtains. Anyhow she would get up and
      dress, and then she would be ready for Jesus whenever he should come.
      True, she was not able to dress herself very well, but he would know, and
      would not mind. She made all the haste she could, consistently with taking
      pains, and was soon attired after a fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      She crept out of the room and down the stair. The house was very still.
      What if Jesus should come and find nobody awake? Would he go again and
      give them no presents? She couldn't expect any herself&mdash;but might he
      not let her take theirs for the rest? Perhaps she ought to wake them all,
      but she dared not without being sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the last landing above the first floor, she saw, by the low gaslight at
      the end of the corridor, an unknown figure pass the foot of the stair:
      could she have anything to do with the marvel of the day? The woman looked
      up, and Phosy dropped the question. Yet she might be a charwoman, whose
      assistance the expected advent rendered necessary. When she reached the
      bottom of the stair she saw her disappearing in her step-mother's room.
      That she did not like. It was the one room into which she could not go.
      But, as the house was so still, she would search everywhere else, and if
      she did not find him, would then sit down in the hall and wait for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room next the foot of the stair, and opposite her step-mother's, was
      the spare room, with which she associated ideas of state and grandeur:
      where better could she begin than at the guest-chamber?&mdash;There!&mdash;Could
      it be? Yes!&mdash;Through the chink of the scarce-closed door she saw
      light. Either he was already there or there they were expecting him. From
      that moment she felt as if lifted out of the body. Far exalted above all
      dread, she peeped modestly in, and then entered. Beyond the foot of the
      bed, a candle stood on a little low table, but nobody was to be seen.
      There was a stool near the table: she would sit on it by the candle, and
      wait for him. But ere she reached it, she caught sight of something upon
      the bed that drew her thither. She stood entranced.&mdash;<i>Could</i> it
      be?&mdash;It <i>might</i> be. Perhaps he had left it there while he went
      into her mamma's room with something for her.&mdash;The loveliest of dolls
      ever imagined! She drew nearer. The light was low, and the shadows were
      many: she could not be sure what it was. But when she had gone close up to
      it, she concluded with certainty that it was in very truth a doll&mdash;perhaps
      intended for her&mdash;but beyond doubt the most exquisite of dolls. She
      dragged a chair to the bed, got, up, pushed her little arms softly under
      it, and drawing it gently to her, slid down with it. When she felt her
      feet firm on the floor, filled with the solemn composure of holy awe she
      carried the gift of the child Jesus to the candle, that she might the
      better admire its beauty and know its preciousness. But the light had no
      sooner fallen upon it than a strange undefinable doubt awoke within her.
      Whatever it was, it was the very essence of loveliness&mdash;the tiny
      darling with its alabaster face, and its delicately modelled hands and
      fingers! A long night-gown covered all the rest.&mdash;Was it possible?&mdash;Could
      it be?&mdash;Yes, indeed! it must be&mdash;it could be nothing else than a
      <i>real</i> baby! What a goose she had been! Of course it was baby Jesus
      himself!&mdash;for was not this his very own Christmas Day on which he was
      always born?&mdash;If she had felt awe of his gift before, what a grandeur
      of adoring love, what a divine dignity possessed her, holding in her arms
      the very child himself! One shudder of bliss passed through her, and in an
      agony of possession she clasped the baby to her great heart&mdash;then at
      once became still with the satisfaction of eternity, with the peace of
      God. She sat down on the stool, near the little table, with her back to
      the candle, that its rays should not fall on the eyes of the sleeping
      Jesus and wake him: there she sat, lost in the very majesty of bliss, at
      once the mother and the slave of the Lord Jesus.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat for a time still as marble waiting for marble to awake, heedful as
      tenderest woman not to rouse him before his time, though her heart was
      swelling with the eager petition that he would ask his Father to be as
      good as chasten her. And as she sat, she began, after her wont, to model
      her face to the likeness of his, that she might understand his stillness&mdash;the
      absolute peace that dwelt on his countenance. But as she did so, again a
      sudden doubt invaded her: Jesus lay so very still&mdash;never moved, never
      opened his pale eye-lids! And now set thinking, she noted that he did not
      breathe. She had seen babies asleep, and their breath came and went&mdash;their
      little bosoms heaved up and down, and sometimes they would smile, and
      sometimes they would moan and sigh. But Jesus did none of all these
      things: was it not strange? And then he was cold&mdash;oh, so cold!
    </p>
    <p>
      A blue silk coverlid lay on the bed: she half rose and dragged it off, and
      contrived to wind it around herself and the baby. Sad at heart, very sad,
      but undismayed, she sat and watched him on her lap.

      CHAPTER VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Meantime the morning of Christmas Day grew. The light came and filled the
      house. The sleepers slept late, but at length they stirred. Alice awoke
      last&mdash;from a troubled sleep, in which the events of the night mingled
      with her own lost condition and destiny. After all Polly had been kind,
      she thought, and got Sophy up without disturbing her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been but a few minutes down, when a strange and appalling rumour
      made itself&mdash;I cannot say audible, but&mdash;somehow known through
      the house, and every one hurried up in horrible dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nurse had gone into the spare room, and missed the little dead thing
      she had laid there. The bed was between her and Phosy, and she never saw
      her. The doctor had been sharp with her about something the night before:
      she now took her revenge in suspicion of him, and after a hasty and
      fruitless visit of inquiry to the kitchen, hurried to Mr. Greatorex.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servants crowded to the spare room, and when their master, incredulous
      indeed, yet shocked at the tidings brought him, hastened to the spot, he
      found them all in the room, gathered at the foot of the bed. A little
      sunlight filtered through the red window-curtains, and gave a strange
      pallid expression to the flame of the candle, which had now burned very
      low. At first he saw nothing but the group of servants, silent,
      motionless, with heads leaning forward, intently gazing: he had come just
      in time: another moment and they would have ruined the lovely sight. He
      stepped forward, and saw Phosy, half shrouded in blue, the candle behind
      illuminating the hair she had found too rebellious to the brush, and
      making of it a faint aureole about her head and white face, whence cold
      and sorrow had driven all the flush, rendering it colourless as that upon
      her arm which had never seen the light. She had pored on the little face
      until she knew death, and now she sat a speechless mother of sorrow,
      bending in the dim light of the tomb over the body of her holy infant.
    </p>
    <p>
      How it was I cannot tell, but the moment her father saw her she looked up,
      and the spell of her dumbness broke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jesus is dead," she said, slowly and sadly, but with perfect calmness.
      "He is dead," she repeated. "He came too early, and there was no one up to
      take care of him, and he's dead&mdash;dead&mdash;dead!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But as she spoke the last words, the frozen lump of agony gave way; the
      well of her heart suddenly filled, swelled, overflowed; the last word was
      half sob, half shriek of utter despair and loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice darted forward and took the dead baby tenderly from her. The same
      moment her father raised the little mother and clasped her to his bosom.
      Her arms went round his neck, her head sank on his shoulder, and sobbing
      in grievous misery, yet already a little comforted, he bore her from the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, Phosy!" they heard him say, "Jesus is not dead, thank God. It is
      only your little brother that hadn't life enough, and is gone back to God
      for more."
    </p>
    <p>
      Weeping the women went down the stairs. Alice's tears were still flowing,
      when John Jephson entered. Her own troubles forgotten in the emotion of
      the scene she had just witnessed, she ran to his arms and wept on his
      bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      John stood as one astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O Lord! this <i>is</i> a Christmas!" he sighed at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh John!" cried Alice, and tore herself from his embrace, "I forgot!
      You'll never speak to me again, John! Don't do it, John."
    </p>
    <p>
      And with the words she gave a stifled cry, and fell a weeping again,
      behind her two shielding hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Alice!&mdash;you ain't married, are you?" gasped John, to whom that
      was the only possible evil.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, John, and never shall be: a respectable man like you would never
      think of looking twice at a poor girl like me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let's have one more look anyhow," said John, drawing her hands from her
      face. "Tell me what's the matter, and if there's anything can be done to
      right you, I'll work day and night to do it, Alice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's nothing <i>can</i> be done, John," replied Alice, and would again
      have floated out on the ocean of her misery, but in spite of wind and
      tide, that is sobs and tears, she held on by the shore at his entreaty,
      and told her tale, not even omitting the fact that when she went to the
      eldest of the cousins, inheriting through the misfortune of her and her
      brother so much more than their expected share, and "demeaned herself" to
      beg a little help for her brother, who was dying of consumption, he had
      all but ordered her out of the house, swearing he had nothing to do with
      her or her brother, and saying she ought to be ashamed to show her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And that when we used to make mud pies together!" concluded Alice with
      indignation. "There, John! you have it all," she added. "&mdash;And now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      With the word she gave a deep, humbly questioning look into his honest
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that all, Alice?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, John; ain't it enough?" she returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "More'n enough," answered John. "I swear to you, Alice, you're worth to me
      ten times what you would ha' been, even if you'd ha' had me, with ten
      thousand pounds in your ridicule. Why, my woman, I never saw you look one
      'alf so 'an'some as you do now!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the disgrace of it, John!" said Alice, hanging her head, and so
      hiding the pleasure that would dawn through all the mist of her misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let your father and mother settle that betwixt 'em, Alice. 'Tain't none
      o' my business. Please God, we'll do different.&mdash;When shall it be, my
      girl?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "When you like, John," answered Alice, without raising her head,
      thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had withdrawn herself from the too rigorous embrace with which he
      received her consent, she remarked&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do believe, John, money ain't a good thing! Sure as I live, with the
      very wind o' that money, the devil entered into me. Didn't you hate me,
      John? Speak the truth now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Alice. I did cry a bit over you, though. You <i>was</i> possessed
      like."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I <i>was</i> possessed. I do believe if that money hadn't been took from
      me, I'd never ha' had you, John. Ain't it awful to think on?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, no. O' coorse! How could ye?" said Jephson&mdash;with reluctance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, John, don't ye talk like that, for I won't stand it. Don't you go
      for to set me up again with excusin' of me. I'm a nasty conceited cat, I
      am&mdash;and all for nothing but mean pride."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mind ye, ye're mine now, Alice; an' what's mine's mine, an' I won't have
      it abused. I knows you twice the woman you was afore, and all the world
      couldn't gi' me such another Christmas-box&mdash;no, not if it was all
      gold watches and roast beef."
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Greatorex returned to his wife's room, and thought to find her
      asleep as he had left her, he was dismayed to hear sounds of soft weeping
      from the bed. Some tone or stray word, never intended to reach her ear,
      had been enough to reveal the truth concerning her baby.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush! hush!" he said, with more love in his heart than had moved there
      for many months, and therefore more in his tone than she had heard for as
      many;&mdash;"if you cry you will be ill. Hush, my dear!"
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment, ere he could prevent her, she had flung her arms around his
      neck as he stooped over her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Husband! husband!" she cried, "is it my fault?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You behaved perfectly," he returned. "No woman could have been braver."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, but I wouldn't stay at home when you wanted me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind that now, my child," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the word she pulled his face down to hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have <i>you</i>, and I don't care," he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Do</i> you care to have me?" she said, with a sob that ended in a loud
      cry. "Oh! I don't deserve it. But I <i>will</i> be good after this. I
      promise you I will."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you must begin now, my darling. You must lie perfectly still, and
      not cry a bit, or you will go after the baby, and I shall be left alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up at him with such a light in her face as he had never dreamed
      of there before. He had never seen her so lovely. Then she withdrew her
      arms, repressed her tears, smiled, and turned her face away. He put her
      hands under the clothes, and in a minute or two she was again fast asleep.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      That day, when Phosy and her father had sat down to their Christmas
      dinner, he rose again, and taking her up as she sat, chair and all, set
      her down close to him, on the other side of the corner of the table. It
      was the first of a new covenant between them. The father's eyes having
      been suddenly opened to her character and preciousness, as well as to his
      own neglected duty in regard to her, it was as if a well of life had burst
      forth at his feet. And every day, as he looked in her face and talked to
      her, it was with more and more respect for what he found in her, with
      growing tenderness for her predilections, and reverence for the divine
      idea enclosed in her ignorance, for her childish wisdom, and her calm
      seeking&mdash;until at length he would have been horrified at the thought
      of training her up in <i>his</i> way: had she not a way of her own to go&mdash;following&mdash;not
      the dead Jesus, but Him who liveth for evermore? In the endeavour to help
      her, he had to find his own position towards the truth; and the results
      were weighty.&mdash;Nor did the child's influence work forward merely. In
      his intercourse with her he was so often reminded of his first wife, and
      that, with the gloss or comment of a childish reproduction, that his
      memories of her at length grew a little tender, and through the child he
      began to understand the nature and worth of the mother. In her child she
      had given him what she could not be herself. Unable to keep up with him,
      she had handed him her baby, and dropped on the path.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was little Sophy his only comfort. Through their common loss and her
      husband's tenderness, Letty began to grow a woman. And her growth was the
      more rapid that, himself taught through Phosy, her husband no longer
      desired to make her adopt his tastes, and judge with his experiences, but,
      as became the elder and the tried, entered into her tastes and experiences&mdash;became,
      as it were, a child again with her, that, through the thing she was, he
      might help the thing she had to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as she was able to bear it, he told her the story of the dead
      Jesus, and with the tale came to her heart love for Phosy. She had lost a
      son for a season, but she had gained a daughter for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such were the gifts the Christ-child brought to one household that
      Christmas. And the days of the mourning of that household were ended.

    <p>
      There was once a witch who desired to know everything. But the wiser a
      witch is, the harder she knocks her head against the wall when she comes
      to it. Her name was Watho, and she had a wolf in her mind. She cared for
      nothing in itself&mdash;only for knowing it. She was not naturally cruel,
      but the wolf had made her cruel.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was tall and graceful, with a white skin, red hair, and black eyes,
      which had a red fire in them. She was straight and strong, but now and
      then would fall bent together, shudder, and sit for a moment with her head
      turned over her shoulder, as if the wolf had got out of her mind on to her
      back.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II. AURORA.
    </h2>
    <p>
      This witch got two ladies to visit her. One of them belonged to the court,
      and her husband had been sent on a far and difficult embassy. The other
      was a young widow whose husband had lately died, and who had since lost
      her sight, Watho lodged them in different parts of her castle, and they
      did not know of each other's existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The castle stood on the side of a hill sloping gently down into a narrow
      valley, in which was a river, with a pebbly channel and a continual song.
      The garden went down to the bank of the river, enclosed by high walls,
      which crossed the river and there stopped. Each wall had a double row of
      battlements, and between the rows was a narrow walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the topmost story of the castle the Lady Aurora occupied a spacious
      apartment of several large rooms looking southward. The windows projected
      oriel-wise over the garden below, and there was a splendid view from them
      both up and down and across the river. The opposite side of the valley was
      steep, but not very high. Far away snow-peaks were visible. These rooms
      Aurora seldom left, but their airy spaces, the brilliant landscape and
      sky, the plentiful sunlight, the musical instruments, books, pictures,
      curiosities, with the company of Watho who made herself charming,
      precluded all dulness. She had venison and feathered game to eat, milk and
      pale sunny sparkling wine to drink.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had hair of the yellow gold, waved and rippled; her skin was fair, not
      white like Watho's, and her eyes were of the blue of the heavens when
      bluest; her features were delicate but strong, her mouth large and finely
      curved, and haunted with smiles.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III. VESPER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Behind the castle the hill rose abruptly; the north-eastern tower, indeed,
      was in contact with the rock, and communicated with the interior of it.
      For in the rock was a series of chambers, known only to Watho and the one
      servant whom she trusted, called Falca. Some former owner had constructed
      these chambers after the tomb of an Egyptian king, and probably with the
      same design, for in the centre of one of them stood what could only be a
      sarcophagus, but that and others were walled off. The sides and roofs of
      them were carved in low relief, and curiously painted. Here the witch
      lodged the blind lady, whose name was Vesper. Her eyes were black, with
      long black lashes; her skin had a look of darkened silver, but was of
      purest tint and grain; her hair was black and fine and straight-flowing;
      her features were exquisitely formed, and if less beautiful yet more
      lovely from sadness; she always looked as if she wanted to lie down and
      not rise again. She did not know she was lodged in a tomb, though now and
      then she wondered she never touched a window. There were many couches,
      covered with richest silk, and soft as her own cheek, for her to lie upon;
      and the carpets were so thick, she might have cast herself down anywhere&mdash;as
      befitted a tomb. The place was dry and warm, and cunningly pierced for
      air, so that it was always fresh, and lacked only sunlight. There the
      witch fed her upon milk, and wine dark as a carbuncle, and pomegranates,
      and purple grapes, and birds that dwell in marshy places; and she played
      to her mournful tunes, and caused wailful violins to attend her, and told
      her sad tales, thus holding her ever in an atmosphere of sweet sorrow.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV. PHOTOGEN.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Watho at length had her desire, for witches often get what they want: a
      splendid boy was born to the fair Aurora. Just as the sun rose, he opened
      his eyes. Watho carried him immediately to a distant part of the castle,
      and persuaded the mother that he never cried but once, dying the moment he
      was born. Overcome with grief, Aurora left the castle as soon as she was
      able, and Watho never invited her again.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now the witch's care was, that the child should not know darkness.
      Persistently she trained him until at last he never slept during the day,
      and never woke during the night. She never let him see anything black, and
      even kept all dull colours out of his way. Never, if she could help it,
      would she let a shadow fall upon him, watching against shadows as if they
      had been live things that would hurt him. All day he basked in the full
      splendour of the sun, in the same large rooms his mother had occupied.
      Watho used him to the sun, until he could bear more of it than any
      dark-blooded African. In the hottest of every day, she stript him and laid
      him in it, that he might ripen like a peach; and the boy rejoiced in it,
      and would resist being dressed again. She brought all her knowledge to
      bear on making his muscles strong and elastic and swiftly responsive&mdash;that
      his soul, she said laughing, might sit in every fibre, be all in every
      part, and awake the moment of call. His hair was of the red gold, but his
      eyes grew darker as he grew, until they were as black as Vesper's. He was
      the merriest of creatures, always laughing, always loving, for a moment
      raging, then laughing afresh. Watho called him Photogen.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V. NYCTERIS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Five or six months after the birth of Photogen, the dark lady also gave
      birth to a baby: in the windowless tomb of a blind mother, in the dead of
      night, under the feeble rays of a lamp in an alabaster globe, a girl came
      into the darkness with a wail. And just as she was born for the first
      time, Vesper was born for the second, and passed into a world as unknown
      to her as this was to her child&mdash;who would have to be born yet again
      before she could see her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Watho called her Nycteris, and she grew as like Vesper as possible&mdash;in
      all but one particular. She had the same dark skin, dark eyelashes and
      brows, dark hair, and gentle sad look; but she had just the eyes of
      Aurora, the mother of Photogen, and if they grew darker as she grew older,
      it was only a darker blue. Watho, with the help of Falca, took the
      greatest possible care of her&mdash;in every way consistent with her
      plans, that is,&mdash;the main point in which was that she should never
      see any light but what came from the lamp. Hence her optic nerves, and
      indeed her whole apparatus for seeing, grew both larger and more
      sensitive; her eyes, indeed, stopped short only of being too large. Under
      her dark hair and forehead and eyebrows, they looked like two breaks in a
      cloudy night-sky, through which peeped the heaven where the stars and no
      clouds live. She was a sadly dainty little creature. No one in the world
      except those two was aware of the being of the little bat. Watho trained
      her to sleep during the day, and wake during the night. She taught her
      music, in which she was herself a proficient, and taught her scarcely
      anything else.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI. HOW PHOTOGEN GREW.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The hollow in which the castle of Watho lay, was a cleft in a plain rather
      than a valley among hills, for at the top of its steep sides, both north
      and south, was a table-land, large and wide. It was covered with rich
      grass and flowers, with here and there a wood, the outlying colony of a
      great forest. These grassy plains were the finest hunting grounds in the
      world. Great herds of small, but fierce cattle, with humps and shaggy
      manes, roved about them, also antelopes and gnus, and the tiny roedeer,
      while the woods were swarming with wild creatures. The tables of the
      castle were mainly supplied from them. The chief of Watho's huntsmen was a
      fine fellow, and when Photogen began to outgrow the training she could
      give him, she handed him over to Fargu. He with a will set about teaching
      him all he knew. He got him pony after pony, larger and larger as he grew,
      every one less manageable than that which had preceded it, and advanced
      him from pony to horse, and from horse to horse, until he was equal to
      anything in that kind which the country produced. In similar fashion he
      trained him to the use of bow and arrow, substituting every three months a
      stronger bow and longer arrows; and soon he became, even on horseback, a
      wonderful archer. He was but fourteen when he killed his first bull,
      causing jubilation among the huntsmen, and, indeed, through all the
      castle, for there too he was the favourite. Every day, almost as soon as
      the sun was up, he went out hunting, and would in general be out nearly
      the whole of the day. But Watho had laid upon Fargu just one commandment,
      namely, that Photogen should on no account, whatever the plea, be out
      until sundown, or so near it as to wake in him the desire of seeing what
      was going to happen; and this commandment Fargu was anxiously careful not
      to break; for, although he would not have trembled had a whole herd of
      bulls come down upon him, charging at full speed across the level, and not
      an arrow left in his quiver, he was more than afraid of his mistress. When
      she looked at him in a certain way, he felt, he said, as if his heart
      turned to ashes in his breast, and what ran in his veins was no longer
      blood, but milk and water. So that, ere long, as Photogen grew older,
      Fargu began to tremble, for he found it steadily growing harder to
      restrain him. So full of life was he, as Fargu said to his mistress, much
      to her content, that he was more like a live thunderbolt than a human
      being. He did not know what fear was, and that not because he did not know
      danger; for he had had a severe laceration from the razor-like tusk of a
      boar&mdash;whose spine, however, he had severed with one blow of his
      hunting-knife, before Fargu could reach him with defence. When he would
      spur his horse into the midst of a herd of bulls, carrying only his bow
      and his short sword, or shoot an arrow into a herd, and go after it as if
      to reclaim it for a runaway shaft, arriving in time to follow it with a
      spear-thrust before the wounded animal knew which way to charge, Fargu
      thought with terror how it would be when he came to know the temptation of
      the huddle-spot leopards, and the knife-clawed lynxes, with which the
      forest was haunted. For the boy had been so steeped in the sun, from
      childhood so saturated with his influence, that he looked upon every
      danger from a sovereign height of courage. When, therefore, he was
      approaching his sixteenth year, Fargu ventured to beg of Watho that she
      would lay her commands upon the youth himself, and release him from
      responsibility for him. One might as soon hold a tawny-maned lion as
      Photogen, he said. Watho called the youth, and in the presence of Fargu
      laid her command upon him never to be out when the rim of the sun should
      touch the horizon, accompanying the prohibition with hints of
      consequences, none the less awful that they were obscure. Photogen
      listened respectfully, but, knowing neither the taste of fear nor the
      temptation of the night, her words were but sounds to him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII. HOW NYCTERIS GREW.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The little education she intended Nycteris to have, Watho gave her by word
      of mouth. Not meaning she should have light enough to read by, to leave
      other reasons unmentioned, she never put a book in her hands. Nycteris,
      however, saw so much better than Watho imagined, that the light she gave
      her was quite sufficient, and she managed to coax Falca into teaching her
      the letters, after which she taught herself to read, and Falca now and
      then brought her a child's book. But her chief pleasure was in her
      instrument. Her very fingers loved it, and would wander about over its
      keys like feeding sheep. She was not unhappy. She knew nothing of the
      world except the tomb in which she dwelt, and had some pleasure in
      everything she did. But she desired, nevertheless, something more or
      different. She did not know what it was, and the nearest she could come to
      expressing it to herself was&mdash;that she wanted more room. Watho and
      Falca would go from her beyond the shine of the lamp, and come again;
      therefore surely there must be more room somewhere. As often as she was
      left alone, she would fall to poring over the coloured bas-reliefs on the
      walls. These were intended to represent various of the powers of Nature
      under allegorical similitudes, and as nothing can be made that does not
      belong to the general scheme, she could not fail at least to imagine a
      flicker of relationship between some of them, and thus a shadow of the
      reality of things found its way to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was one thing, however, which moved and taught her more than all the
      rest&mdash;the lamp, namely, that hung from the ceiling, which she always
      saw alight, though she never saw the flame, only the slight condensation
      towards the centre of the alabaster globe. And besides the operation of
      the light itself after its kind, the indefiniteness of the globe, and the
      softness of the light, giving her the feeling as if her eyes could go in
      and into its whiteness, were somehow also associated with the idea of
      space and room. She would sit for an hour together gazing up at the lamp,
      and her heart would swell as she gazed. She would wonder what had hurt
      her, when she found her face wet with tears, and then would wonder how she
      could have been hurt without knowing it. She never looked thus at the lamp
      except when she was alone.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII. THE LAMP.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Watho having given orders, took it for granted they were obeyed, and that
      Falca was all night long with Nycteris, whose day it was. But Falca could
      not get into the habit of sleeping through the day, and would often leave
      her alone half the night. Then it seemed to Nycteris that the white lamp
      was watching over her. As it was never permitted to go out&mdash;while she
      was awake at least&mdash;Nycteris, except by shutting her eyes, knew less
      about darkness than she did about light. Also, the lamp being fixed high
      overhead, and in the centre of everything, she did not know much about
      shadows either. The few there were fell almost entirely on the floor, or
      kept like mice about the foot of the walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once, when she was thus alone, there came the noise of a far-off rumbling:
      she had never before heard a sound of which she did not know the origin,
      and here therefore was a new sign of something beyond these chambers. Then
      came a trembling, then a shaking; the lamp dropped from the ceiling to the
      floor with a great crash, and she felt as if both her eyes were hard shut
      and both her hands over them. She concluded that it was the darkness that
      had made the rumbling and the shaking, and rushing into the room, had
      thrown down the lamp. She sat trembling. The noise and the shaking ceased,
      but the light did not return. The darkness had eaten it up!
    </p>
    <p>
      Her lamp gone, the desire at once awoke to get out of her prison. She
      scarcely knew what <i>out</i> meant; out of one room into another, where
      there was not even a dividing door, only an open arch, was all she knew of
      the world. But suddenly she remembered that she had heard Falca speak of
      the lamp <i>going out</i>: this must be what she had meant? And if the
      lamp had gone out, where had it gone? Surely where Falca went, and like
      her it would come again. But she could not wait. The desire to go out grew
      irresistible. She must follow her beautiful lamp! She must find it! She
      must see what it was about!
    </p>
    <p>
      Now there was a curtain covering a recess in the wall, where some of her
      toys and gymnastic things were kept; and from behind that curtain Watho
      and Falca always appeared, and behind it they vanished. How they came out
      of solid wall, she had not an idea, all up to the wall was open space, and
      all beyond it seemed wall; but clearly the first and only thing she could
      do, was to feel her way behind the curtain. It was so dark that a cat
      could not have caught the largest of mice. Nycteris could see better than
      any cat, but now her great eyes were not of the smallest use to her. As
      she went she trod upon a piece of the broken lamp. She had never worn
      shoes or stockings, and the fragment, though, being of soft alabaster, it
      did not cut, yet hurt her foot. She did not know what it was, but as it
      had not been there before the darkness came, she suspected that it had to
      do with the lamp. She kneeled therefore, and searched with her hands, and
      bringing two large pieces together, recognized the shape of the lamp.
      Therewith it flashed upon her that the lamp was dead, that this brokenness
      was the death of which she had read without understanding, that the
      darkness had killed the lamp. What then could Falca have meant when she
      spoke of the lamp <i>going out</i>? There was the lamp&mdash;dead, indeed,
      and so changed that she would never have taken it for a lamp but for the
      shape! No, it was not the lamp any more now it was dead, for all that made
      it a lamp was gone, namely, the bright shining of it. Then it must be the
      shine, the light, that had gone out! That must be what Falca meant&mdash;and
      it must be somewhere in the other place in the wall. She started afresh
      after it, and groped her way to the curtain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now she had never in her life tried to get out, and did not know how; but
      instinctively she began to move her hands about over one of the walls
      behind the curtain, half expecting them to go into it, as she supposed
      Watho and Falca did. But the wall repelled her with inexorable hardness,
      and she turned to the one opposite. In so doing, she set her foot upon an
      ivory die, and as it met sharply the same spot the broken alabaster had
      already hurt, she fell forward with her outstretched hands against the
      wall. Something gave way, and she tumbled out of the cavern.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX. OUT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      But alas! <i>out</i> was very much like <i>in</i>, for the same enemy, the
      darkness, was here also. The next moment, however, came a great gladness&mdash;a
      firefly, which had wandered in from the garden. She saw the tiny spark in
      the distance. With slow pulsing ebb and throb of light, it came pushing
      itself through the air, drawing nearer and nearer, with that motion which
      more resembles swimming than flying, and the light seemed the source of
      its own motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My lamp! my lamp!" cried Nycteris. "It is the shiningness of my lamp,
      which the cruel darkness drove out. My good lamp has been waiting for me
      here all the time! It knew I would come after it, and waited to take me
      with it."
    </p>
    <p>
      She followed the firefly, which, like herself, was seeking the way out. If
      it did not know the way, it was yet light; and, because all light is one,
      any light may serve to guide to more light. If she was mistaken in
      thinking it the spirit of her lamp, it was of the same spirit as her lamp&mdash;and
      had wings. The gold-green jet-boat, driven by light, went throbbing before
      her through a long narrow passage. Suddenly it rose higher, and the same
      moment Nycteris fell upon an ascending stair. She had never seen a stair
      before, and found going-up a curious sensation. Just as she reached what
      seemed the top, the firefly ceased to shine, and so disappeared. She was
      in utter darkness once more. But when we are following the light, even its
      extinction is a guide. If the firefly had gone on shining, Nycteris would
      have seen the stair turn, and would have gone up to Watho's bedroom;
      whereas now, feeling straight before her, she came to a latched door,
      which after a good deal of trying she managed to open&mdash;and stood in a
      maze of wondering perplexity, awe, and delight. What was it? Was it
      outside of her, or something taking place in her head? Before her was a
      very long and very narrow passage, broken up she could not tell how, and
      spreading out above and on all sides to an infinite height and breadth and
      distance&mdash;as if space itself were growing out of a trough. It was
      brighter than her rooms had ever been&mdash;brighter than if six alabaster
      lamps had been burning in them. There was a quantity of strange streaking
      and mottling about it, very different from the shapes on her walls. She
      was in a dream of pleasant perplexity, of delightful bewilderment. She
      could not tell whether she was upon her feet or drifting about like the
      firefly, driven by the pulses of an inward bliss. But she knew little as
      yet of her inheritance. Unconsciously she took one step forward from the
      threshold, and the girl who had been from her very birth a troglodyte,
      stood in the ravishing glory of a southern night, lit by a perfect moon&mdash;not
      the moon of our northern clime, but a moon like silver glowing in a
      furnace&mdash;a moon one could see to be a globe&mdash;not far off, a mere
      flat disc on the face of the blue, but hanging down halfway, and looking
      as if one could see all round it by a mere bending of the neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is my lamp!" she said, and stood dumb with parted lips. She looked and
      felt as if she had been standing there in silent ecstasy from the
      beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, it is not my lamp," she said after a while; "it is the mother of all
      the lamps."
    </p>
    <p>
      And with that she fell on her knees, and spread out her hands to the moon.
      She could not in the least have told what was in her mind, but the action
      was in reality just a begging of the moon to be what she was&mdash;that
      precise incredible splendour hung in the far-off roof, that very glory
      essential to the being of poor girls born and bred in caverns. It was a
      resurrection&mdash;nay, a birth itself, to Nycteris. What the vast blue
      sky, studded with tiny sparks like the heads of diamond nails, could be;
      what the moon, looking so absolutely content with light.&mdash;why, she
      knew less about them than you and I! but the greatest of astronomers might
      envy the rapture of such a first impression at the age of sixteen.
      Immeasurably imperfect it was, but false the impression could not be, for
      she saw with the eyes made for seeing, and saw indeed what many men are
      too wise to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she knelt, something softly flapped her, embraced her, stroked her,
      fondled her. She rose to her feet, but saw nothing, did not know what it
      was. It was likest a woman's breath. For she know nothing of the air even,
      had never breathed the still newborn freshness of the world. Her breath
      had come to her only through long passages and spirals in the rock. Still
      less did she know of the air alive with motion&mdash;of that thrice
      blessed thing, the wind of a summer night. It was like a spiritual wine,
      filling her whole being with an intoxication of purest joy. To breathe was
      a perfect existence. It seemed to her the light itself she drew into her
      lungs. Possessed by the power of the gorgeous night, she seemed at one and
      the same moment annihilated and glorified.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was in the open passage or gallery that ran round the top of the
      garden walls, between the cleft battlements, but she did not once look
      down to see what lay beneath. Her soul was drawn to the vault above her,
      with its lamp and its endless room. At last she burst into tears, and her
      heart was relieved, as the night itself is relieved by its lightning and
      rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now she grew thoughtful. She must hoard this splendour! What a little
      ignorance her gaolers had made of her! Life was a mighty bliss, and they
      had scraped hers to the bare bone! They must not know that she knew. She
      must hide her knowledge&mdash;hide it even from her own eyes, keeping it
      close in her bosom, content to know that she had it, even when she could
      not brood on its presence, feasting her eyes with its glory. She turned
      from the vision, therefore, with a sigh of utter bliss, and with soft
      quiet steps and groping hands, stole back into the darkness of the rock.
      What was darkness or the laziness of Time's feet to one who had seen what
      she had that night seen? She was lifted above all weariness&mdash;above
      all wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Falca entered, she uttered a cry of terror. But Nycteris called to
      her not to be afraid, and told her how there had come a rumbling and a
      shaking, and the lamp had fallen. Then Falca went and told her mistress,
      and within an hour a new globe hung in the place of the old one. Nycteris
      thought it did not look so bright and clear as the former, but she made no
      lamentation over the change; she was far too rich to heed it. For now,
      prisoner as she knew herself, her heart was full of glory and gladness; at
      times she had to hold herself from jumping up, and going dancing and
      singing about the room. When she slept, instead of dull dreams, she had
      splendid visions. There were times, it is true, when she became restless,
      and impatient to look upon her riches, but then she would reason with
      herself, saying, "What does it matter if I sit here for ages with my poor
      pale lamp, when out there a lump is burning at which ten thousand little
      lamps are glowing with wonder?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She never doubted she had looked upon the day and the sun, of which she
      had read; and always when she read of the day and the sun, she had the
      night and the moon in her mind; and when she read of the night and the
      moon, she thought only of the cave and the lamp that hung there.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X. THE GREAT LAMP.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was some time before she had a second opportunity of going out, for
      Falca, since the fall of the lamp, had been a little more careful, and
      seldom left her for long. But one night, having a little headache,
      Nycteris lay down upon her bed, and was lying with her eyes closed, when
      she heard Falca come to her, and felt she was bending over her.
      Disinclined to talk, she did not open her eyes, and lay quite still.
      Satisfied that she was asleep, Falca left her, moving so softly that her
      very caution made Nycteris open her eyes and look after her&mdash;just in
      time to see her vanish&mdash;through a picture, as it seemed, that hung on
      the wall a long way from the usual place of issue. She jumped up, her
      headache forgotten, and ran in the opposite direction; got out, groped her
      way to the stair, climbed, and reached the top of the wall.&mdash;Alas!
      the great room was not so light as the little one she had left. Why?&mdash;Sorrow
      of sorrows! the great lamp was gone! Had its globe fallen? and its lovely
      light gone out upon great wings, a resplendent firefly, oaring itself
      through a yet grander and lovelier room? She looked down to see if it lay
      anywhere broken to pieces on the carpet below; but she could not even see
      the carpet. But surely nothing very dreadful could have happened&mdash;no
      rumbling or shaking, for there were all the little lamps shining brighter
      than before, not one of them looking as if any unusual matter had
      befallen. What if each of those little lamps was growing into a big lamp,
      and after being a big lamp for a while, had to go out and grow a bigger
      lamp still&mdash;out there, beyond this <i>out</i>?&mdash;Ah! here was the
      living thing that would not be seen, come to her again&mdash;bigger
      to-night! with such loving kisses, and such liquid strokings of her cheeks
      and forehead, gently tossing her hair, and delicately toying with it! But
      it ceased, and all was still. Had it gone out? What would happen next?
      Perhaps the little lamps had not to grow great lamps, but to fall one by
      one and go out first?&mdash;With that, came from below a sweet scent, then
      another, and another. Ah, how delicious! Perhaps they were all coming to
      her only on their way out after the great lamp!&mdash;Then came the music
      of the river, which she had been too absorbed in the sky to note the first
      time. What was it? Alas! alas! another sweet living thing on its way out.
      They were all marching slowly out in long lovely file, one after the
      other, each taking its leave of her as it passed! It must be so: here were
      more and more sweet sounds, following and fading! The whole of the <i>Out</i>
      was going out again; it was all going after the great lovely lamp! She
      would be left the only creature in the solitary day! Was there nobody to
      hang up a new lamp for the old one, and keep the creatures from going?&mdash;She
      crept back to her rock very sad. She tried to comfort herself by saying
      that anyhow there would be room out there; but as she said it she
      shuddered at the thought of <i>empty</i> room.
    </p>
    <p>
      When next she succeeded in getting out, a half-moon hung in the east: a
      new lamp had come, she thought, and all would be well.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be endless to describe the phases of feeling through which
      Nycteris passed, more numerous and delicate than those of a thousand
      changing moons. A fresh bliss bloomed in her soul with every varying
      aspect of infinite nature. Ere long she began to suspect that the new moon
      was the old moon, gone out and come in again like herself; also that,
      unlike herself, it wasted and grew again; that it was indeed a live thing,
      subject like herself to caverns, and keepers, and solitudes, escaping and
      shining when it could. Was it a prison like hers it was shut in? and did
      it grow dark when the lamp left it? Where could be the way into it?&mdash;With
      that first she began to look below, as well as above and around her; and
      then first noted the tops of the trees between her and the floor. There
      were palms with their red-fingered hands full of fruit; eucalyptus trees
      crowded with little boxes of powder-puffs; oleanders with their half-caste
      roses; and orange trees with their clouds of young silver stars, and their
      aged balls of gold. Her eyes could see colours invisible to ours in the
      moonlight, and all these she could distinguish well, though at first she
      took them for the shapes and colours of the carpet of the great room. She
      longed to get down among them, now she saw they were real creatures, but
      she did not know how. She went along the whole length of the wall to the
      end that crossed the river, but found no way of going down. Above the
      river she stopped to gaze with awe upon the rushing water. She knew
      nothing of water but from what she drank and what she bathed in; and, as
      the moon shone on the dark, swift stream, singing lustily as it flowed,
      she did not doubt the river was alive, a swift rushing serpent of life,
      going&mdash;out?&mdash;whither? And then she wondered if what was brought
      into her rooms had been killed that she might drink it, and have her bath
      in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once when she stepped out upon the wall, it was into the midst of a fierce
      wind. The trees were all roaring. Great clouds were rushing along the
      skies, and tumbling over the little lamps: the great lamp had not come
      yet. All was in tumult. The wind seized her garments and hair, and shook
      them as if it would tear them from her. What could she have done to make
      the gentle creature so angry? Or was this another creature altogether&mdash;of
      the same kind, but hugely bigger, and of a very different temper and
      behaviour? But the whole place was angry! Or was it that the creatures
      dwelling in it, the wind, and the trees, and the clouds, and the river,
      had all quarrelled, each with all the rest? Would the whole come to
      confusion and disorder? But, as she gazed wondering and disquieted, the
      moon, larger than ever she had seen her, came lifting herself above the
      horizon to look, broad and red, as if she, too, were swollen with anger
      that she had been roused from her rest by their noise, and compelled to
      hurry up to see what her children were about, thus rioting in her absence,
      lest they should rack the whole frame of things. And as she rose, the loud
      wind grew quieter and scolded less fiercely, the trees grew stiller and
      moaned with a lower complaint, and the clouds hunted and hurled themselves
      less wildly across the sky. And as if she were pleased that her children
      obeyed her very presence, the moon grew smaller as she ascended the
      heavenly stair; her puffed cheeks sank, her complexion grew clearer, and a
      sweet smile spread over her countenance, as peacefully she rose and rose.
      But there was treason and rebellion in her court; for, ere she reached the
      top of her great stairs, the clouds had assembled, forgetting their late
      wars, and very still they were as they laid their heads together and
      conspired. Then combining, and lying silently in wait until she came near,
      they threw themselves upon her, and swallowed her up. Down from the roof
      came spots of wet, faster and faster, and they wetted the cheeks of
      Nycteris; and what could they be but the tears of the moon, crying because
      her children were smothering her? Nycteris wept too, and not knowing what
      to think, stole back in dismay to her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next time, she came out in fear and trembling. There was the moon
      still! away in the west&mdash;poor, indeed, and old, and looking
      dreadfully worn, as if all the wild beasts in the sky had been gnawing at
      her&mdash;but there she was, alive still, and able to shine!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI. THE SUNSET.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Knowing nothing of darkness, or stars, or moon, Photogen spent his days in
      hunting. On a great white horse he swept over the grassy plains, glorying
      in the sun, fighting the wind, and killing the buffaloes.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning, when he happened to be on the ground a little earlier than
      usual, and before his attendants, he caught sight of an animal unknown to
      him, stealing from a hollow into which the sunrays had not yet reached.
      Like a swift shadow it sped over the grass, slinking southward to the
      forest. He gave chase, noted the body of a buffalo it had half eaten, and
      pursued it the harder. But with great leaps and bounds the creature shot
      farther and farther ahead of him, and vanished. Turning therefore
      defeated, he met Fargu, who had been following him as fast as his horse
      could carry him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What animal was that, Fargu?" he asked. "How he did run!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Fargu answered he might be a leopard, but he rather thought from his pace
      and look that he was a young lion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a coward he must be!" said Photogen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be too sure of that," rejoined Fargu. "He is one of the creatures
      the sun makes uncomfortable. As soon as the sun is down, he will be brave
      enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had scarcely said it, when he repented nor did he regret it the less
      when he found that Photogen made no reply. But alas! said was said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then," said Photogen to himself, "that contemptible beast is one of the
      terrors of sundown, of which Madam Watho spoke!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He hunted all day, but not with his usual spirit. He did not ride so hard,
      and did not kill one buffalo. Fargu to his dismay observed also that he
      took every pretext for moving farther south, nearer to the forest. But all
      at once, the sun now sinking in the west, he seemed to change his mind,
      for he turned his horse's head, and rode home so fast that the rest could
      not keep him in sight. When they arrived, they found his horse in the
      stable, and concluded that he had gone into the castle. But he had in
      truth set out again by the back of it. Crossing the river a good way up
      the valley, he reascended to the ground they had left, and just before
      sunset reached the skirts of the forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The level orb shone straight in between the bare stems, and saying to
      himself he could not fail to find the beast, he rushed into the wood. But
      even as he entered, he turned, and looked to the west. The rim of the red
      was touching the horizon, all jagged with broken hills. "Now," said
      Photogen, "we shall see;" but he said it in the face of a darkness he had
      not proved. The moment the sun began to sink among the spikes and
      saw-edges, with a kind of sudden flap at his heart a fear inexplicable
      laid hold of the youth; and as he had never felt anything of the kind
      before, the very fear itself terrified him. As the sun sank, it rose like
      the shadow of the world, and grew deeper and darker. He could not even
      think what it might be, so utterly did it enfeeble him. When the last
      flaming scimitar-edge of the sun went out like a lamp, his horror seemed
      to blossom into very madness. Like the closing lids of an eye&mdash;for
      there was no twilight, and this night no moon&mdash;the terror and the
      darkness rushed together, and he knew them for one. He was no longer the
      man he had known, or rather thought himself. The courage he had had was in
      no sense his own&mdash;he had only had courage, not been courageous; it
      had left him, and he could scarcely stand&mdash;certainly not stand
      straight, for not one of his joints could he make stiff or keep from
      trembling. He was but a spark of the sun, in himself nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The beast was behind him&mdash;stealing upon him! He turned. All was dark
      in the wood, but to his fancy the darkness here and there broke into pairs
      of green eyes, and he had not the power even to raise his bow-hand from
      his side. In the strength of despair he strove to rouse courage enough&mdash;not
      to fight&mdash;that he did not even desire&mdash;but to run. Courage to
      flee home was all he could ever imagine, and it would not come. But what
      he had not, was ignominiously given him. A cry in the wood, half a
      screech, half a growl, sent him running like a boar-wounded cur. It was
      not even himself that ran, it was the fear that had come alive in his
      legs: he did not know that they moved. But as he ran he grew able to run&mdash;gained
      courage at least to be a coward. The stars gave a little light. Over the
      grass he sped, and nothing followed him. "How fallen, how changed," from
      the youth who had climbed the hill as the sun went down! A mere contempt
      to himself, the self that contemned was a coward with the self it
      contemned! There lay the shapeless black of a buffalo, humped upon the
      grass: he made a wide circuit, and swept on like a shadow driven in the
      wind. For the wind had arisen, and added to his terror: it blew from
      behind him. He reached the brow of the valley, and shot down the steep
      descent like a falling star. Instantly the whole upper country behind him
      arose and pursued him! The wind came howling after him, filled with
      screams, shrieks, yells, roars, laughter, and chattering, as if all the
      animals of the forest were careering with it. In his ears was a trampling
      rush, the thunder of the hoofs of the cattle, in career from every quarter
      of the wide plains to the brow of the hill above him! He fled straight for
      the castle, scarcely with breath enough to pant.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he reached the bottom of the valley, the moon peered up over its edge.
      He had never seen the moon before&mdash;except in the daytime, when he had
      taken her for a thin bright cloud. She was a fresh terror to him&mdash;so
      ghostly! so ghastly! so gruesome!&mdash;so knowing as she looked over the
      top of her garden-wall upon the world outside! That was the night itself!
      the darkness alive&mdash;and after him! the horror of horrors coming down
      the sky to curdle his blood, and turn his brain to a cinder! He gave a
      sob, and made straight for the river, where it ran between the two walls,
      at the bottom of the garden. He plunged in, struggled through, clambered
      up the bank, and fell senseless on the grass.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII. THE GARDEN.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Although Nycteris took care not to stay out long at a time, and used every
      precaution, she could hardly have escaped discovery so long, had it not
      been that the strange attacks to which Watho was subject had been more
      frequent of late, and had at last settled into an illness which kept her
      to her bed. But whether from an access of caution or from suspicion,
      Falca, having now to be much with her mistress both day and night, took it
      at length into her head to fasten the door as often as she went by her
      usual place of exit; so that one night, when Nycteris pushed, she found,
      to her surprise and dismay, that the wall pushed her again, and would not
      let her through; nor with all her searching could she discover wherein lay
      the cause of the change. Then first she felt the pressure of her
      prison-walls, and turning, half in despair, groped her way to the picture
      where she had once seen Falca disappear. There she soon found the spot by
      pressing upon which the wall yielded. It let her through into a sort of
      cellar, where was a glimmer of light from a sky whose blue was paled by
      the moon. From the cellar she got into a long passage, into which the moon
      was shining, and came to a door. She managed to open it, and, to her great
      joy, found herself in <i>the other place</i>, not on the top of the wall,
      however, but in the garden she had longed to enter. Noiseless as a fluffy
      moth she flitted away into the covert of the trees and shrubs, her bare
      feet welcomed by the softest of carpets, which, by the very touch, her
      feet knew to be alive, whence it came that it was so sweet and friendly to
      them. A soft little wind was out among the trees, running now here, now
      there, like a child that had got its will. She went dancing over the
      grass, looking behind her at her shadow, as she went. At first she had
      taken it for a little black creature that made game of her, but when she
      perceived that it was only where she kept the moon away, and that every
      tree, however great and grand a creature, had also one of these strange
      attendants, she soon learned not to mind it, and by and by it became the
      source of as much amusement to her, as to any kitten its tail. It was long
      before she was quite at home with the trees, however. At one time they
      seemed to disapprove of her; at another not even to know she was there,
      and to be altogether taken up with their own business. Suddenly, as she
      went from one to another of them, looking up with awe at the murmuring
      mystery of their branches and leaves, she spied one a little way off,
      which was very different from all the rest. It was white, and dark, and
      sparkling, and spread like a palm&mdash;a small slender palm, without much
      head; and it grew very fast, and sang as it grew. But it never grew any
      bigger, for just as fast as she could see it growing, it kept falling to
      pieces. When she got close to it, she discovered that it was a water-tree&mdash;made
      of just such water as she washed with&mdash;only it was alive of course,
      like the river&mdash;a different sort of water from that, doubtless,
      seeing the one crept swiftly along the floor, and the other shot straight
      up, and fell, and swallowed itself, and rose again. She put her feet into
      the marble basin, which was the flower-pot in which it grew. It was full
      of real water, living and cool&mdash;so nice, for the night was hot!
    </p>
    <p>
      But the flowers! ah, the flowers! she was friends with them from the very
      first. What wonderful creatures they were!&mdash;and so kind and beautiful&mdash;always
      sending out such colours and such scents&mdash;red scent, and white scent,
      and yellow scent&mdash;for the other creatures! The one that was invisible
      and everywhere, took such a quantity of their scents, and carried it away!
      yet they did not seem to mind. It was their talk, to show they were alive,
      and not painted like those on the walls of her rooms, and on the carpets.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wandered along down the garden until she reached the river. Unable
      then to get any further&mdash;for she was a little afraid, and justly, of
      the swift watery serpent&mdash;she dropped on the grassy bank, dipped her
      feet in the water, and felt it running and pushing against them. For a
      long time she sat thus, and her bliss seemed complete, as she gazed at the
      river, and watched the broken picture of the great lamp overhead, moving
      up one side of the roof, to go down the other.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII. SOMETHING QUITE NEW.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A beautiful moth brushed across the great blue eyes of Nycteris. She
      sprang to her feet to follow it&mdash;not in the spirit of the hunter, but
      of the lover. Her heart&mdash;like every heart, if only its fallen sides
      were cleared away&mdash;was an inexhaustible fountain of love: she loved
      everything she saw. But as she followed the moth, she caught sight of
      something lying on the bank of the river, and not yet having learned to be
      afraid of anything, ran straight to see what it was. Reaching it, she
      stood amazed. Another girl like herself! But what a strange-looking girl!&mdash;so
      curiously dressed too!&mdash;and not able to move! Was she dead? Filled
      suddenly with pity, she sat down, lifted Photogen's head, laid it on her
      lap, and began stroking his face. Her warm hands brought him to himself.
      He opened his black eyes, out of which had gone all the fire, and looked
      up with a strange sound of fear, half moan, half gasp. But when he saw her
      face, he drew a deep breath, and lay motionless&mdash;gazing at her: those
      blue marvels above him, like a better sky, seemed to side with courage and
      assuage his terror. At length, in a trembling, awed voice, and a half
      whisper, he said, "Who are you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am Nycteris," she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a creature of the darkness, and love the night," he said, his
      fear beginning to move again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I may be a creature of the darkness," she replied. "I hardly know what
      you mean. But I do not love the night. I love the day&mdash;with all my
      heart; and I sleep all the night long."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How can that be?" said Photogen, rising on his elbow, but dropping his
      head on her lap again the moment he saw the moon; "&mdash;how can it be,"
      he repeated, "when I see your eyes there&mdash;wide awake?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She only smiled and stroked him, for she did not understand him, and
      thought he did not know what he was saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was it a dream then?" resumed Photogen, rubbing his eyes. But with that
      his memory came clear, and he shuddered, and cried, "Oh horrible!
      horrible! to be turned all at once into a coward! a shameful,
      contemptible, disgraceful coward! I am ashamed&mdash;ashamed&mdash;and <i>so</i>
      frightened! It is all so frightful!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is so frightful?" asked Nycteris, with a smile like that of a mother
      to her child waked from a bad dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All, all," he answered; "all this darkness and the roaring."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear," said Nycteris, "there is no roaring. How sensitive you must be!
      What you hear is only the walking of the water, and the running about of
      the sweetest of all the creatures. She is invisible, and I call her
      Everywhere, for she goes through all the other creatures and comforts
      them. Now she is amusing herself, and them too, with shaking them and
      kissing them, and blowing in their faces. Listen: do you call that
      roaring? You should hear her when she is rather angry though! I don't know
      why, but she is sometimes, and then she does roar a little."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is so horribly dark!" said Photogen, who, listening while she spoke,
      had satisfied himself that there was no roaring.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dark!" she echoed. "You should be in my room when an earthquake has
      killed my lamp. I do not understand. How <i>can</i> you call this dark?
      Let me see: yes, you have eyes, and big ones, bigger than Madam Watho's or
      Falca's&mdash;not so big as mine, I fancy&mdash;only I never saw mine. But
      then&mdash;oh yes!&mdash;I know now what is the matter! You can't see with
      them because they are so black. Darkness can't see, of course. Never mind:
      I will be your eyes, and teach you to see. Look here&mdash;at these lovely
      white things in the grass, with red sharp points all folded together into
      one. Oh, I love them so! I could sit looking at them all day, the
      darlings!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Photogen looked close at the flowers, and thought he had seen something
      like them before, but could not make them out. As Nycteris had never seen
      an open daisy, so had he never seen a closed one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus instinctively Nycteris tried to turn him away from his fear; and the
      beautiful creature's strange lovely talk helped not a little to make him
      forget it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You call it dark!" she said again, as if she could not get rid of the
      absurdity of the idea; "why, I could count every blade of the green hair&mdash;I
      suppose it is what the books call grass&mdash;within two yards of me! And
      just look at the great lamp! It is brighter than usual to-day, and I can't
      think why you should be frightened, or call it dark!"
    </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke, she went on stroking his cheeks and hair, and trying to
      comfort him. But oh how miserable he was! and how plainly he looked it! He
      was on the point of saying that her great lamp was dreadful to him,
      looking like a witch, walking in the sleep of death; but he was not so
      ignorant as Nycteris, and knew even in the moonlight that she was a woman,
      though he had never seen one so young or so lovely before; and while she
      comforted his fear, her presence made him the more ashamed of it. Besides,
      not knowing her nature, he might annoy her, and make her leave him to his
      misery. He lay still therefore, hardly daring to move: all the little life
      he had seemed to come from her, and if he were to move, she might move;
      and if she were to leave him, he must weep like a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How did you come here?" asked Nycteris, taking his face between her
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Down the hill," he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where do you sleep?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He signed in the direction of the house. She gave a little laugh of
      delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When you have learned not to be frightened, you will always be wanting to
      come out with me," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She thought with herself she would ask her presently, when she had come to
      herself a little, how she had made her escape, for she must, of course,
      like herself have got out of a cave, in which Watho and Falca had been
      keeping her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look at the lovely colours," she went on, pointing to a rose-bush, on
      which Photogen could not see a single flower. "They are far more beautiful&mdash;are
      they not?&mdash;than any of the colours upon your walls. And then they are
      alive, and smell so sweet!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He wished she would not make him keep opening his eyes to look at things
      he could not see; and every other moment would start and grasp tight hold
      of her, as some fresh pang of terror shot into him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, come, dear!" said Nycteris; "you must not go on this way. You must
      be a brave girl, and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A girl!" shouted Photogen, and started to his feet in wrath. "If you were
      a man, I should kill you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A man?" repeated Nycteris: "what is that? How could I be that? We are
      both girls&mdash;are we not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I am not a girl," he answered; "&mdash;although," he added, changing
      his tone, and casting himself on the ground at her feet, "I have given you
      too good reason to call me one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I see!" returned Nycteris. "No, of course! you can't be a girl: girls
      are not afraid&mdash;without reason. I understand now: it is because you
      are not a girl that you are so frightened."
    </p>
    <p>
      Photogen twisted and writhed upon the grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, it is not," he said sulkily; "it is this horrible darkness that
      creeps into me, goes all through me, into the very marrow of my bones&mdash;that
      is what makes me behave like a girl. If only the sun would rise!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The sun! what is it?" cried Nycteris, now in her turn conceiving a vague
      fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Photogen broke into a rhapsody, in which he vainly sought to forget
      his.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is the soul, the life, the heart, the glory of the universe," he said.
      "The worlds dance like motes in his beams. The heart of man is strong and
      brave in his light, and when it departs his courage grows from him&mdash;goes
      with the sun, and he becomes such as you see me now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then that is not the sun?" said Nycteris, thoughtfully, pointing up to
      the moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That!" cried Photogen, with utter scorn; "I know nothing about <i>that</i>,
      except that it is ugly and horrible. At best it can be only the ghost of a
      dead sun. Yes, that is it! That is what makes it look so frightful."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Nycteris, after a long, thoughtful pause; "you must be wrong
      there. I think the sun is the ghost of a dead moon, and that is how he is
      so much more splendid as you say.&mdash;Is there, then, another big room,
      where the sun lives in the roof?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not know what you mean," replied Photogen. "But you mean to be kind,
      I know, though you should not call a poor fellow in the dark a girl. If
      you will let me lie here, with my head in your lap, I should like to
      sleep. Will you watch me, and take care of me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, that I will," answered Nycteris, forgetting all her own danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Photogen fell asleep.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV. THE SUN.
    </h2>
    <p>
      There Nycteris sat, and there the youth lay, all night long, in the heart
      of the great cone-shadow of the earth, like two Pharaohs in one pyramid.
      Photogen slept, and slept; and Nycteris sat motionless lest she should
      wake him, and so betray him to his fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moon rode high in the blue eternity; it was a very triumph of glorious
      night; the river ran babble-murmuring in deep soft syllables; the fountain
      kept rushing moon-ward, and blossoming momently to a great silvery flower,
      whose petals were for ever falling like snow, but with a continuous
      musical clash, into the bed of its exhaustion beneath; the wind woke, took
      a run among the trees, went to sleep, and woke again; the daisies slept on
      their feet at hers, but she did not know they slept; the roses might well
      seem awake, for their scent filled the air, but in truth they slept also,
      and the odour was that of their dreams; the oranges hung like gold lamps
      in the trees, and their silvery flowers were the souls of their yet
      unembodied children; the scent of the acacia blooms filled the air like
      the very odour of the moon herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, unused to the living air, and weary with sitting so still and so
      long, Nycteris grew drowsy. The air began to grow cool. It was getting
      near the time when she too was accustomed to sleep. She closed her eyes
      just a moment, and nodded&mdash;opened them suddenly wide, for she had
      promised to watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that moment a change had come. The moon had got round, and was fronting
      her from the west, and she saw that her face was altered, that she had
      grown pale, as if she too were wan with fear, and from her lofty place
      espied a coming terror. The light seemed to be dissolving out of her; she
      was dying&mdash;she was going out! And yet everything around looked
      strangely clear&mdash;clearer than ever she had seen anything before: how
      could the lamp be shedding more light when she herself had less? Ah, that
      was just it! See how faint she looked! It was because the light was
      forsaking her, and spreading itself over the room, that she grew so thin
      and pale! She was giving up everything! She was melting away from the roof
      like a bit of sugar in water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nycteris was fast growing afraid, and sought refuge with the face upon her
      lap. How beautiful the creature was!&mdash;what to call it she could not
      think, for it had been angry when she called it what Watho called her.
      And, wonder upon wonder! now, even in the cold change that was passing
      upon the great room, the colour as of a red rose was rising in the wan
      cheek. What beautiful yellow hair it was that spread over her lap! What
      great huge breaths the creature took! And what were those curious things
      it carried? She had seen them on her walls, she was sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus she talked to herself while the lamp grew paler and paler, and
      everything kept growing yet clearer. What could it mean? The lamp was
      dying&mdash;going out into the other place of which the creature in her
      lap had spoken, to be a sun! But why were the things growing clearer
      before it was yet a sun? That was the point. Was it her growing into a sun
      that did it? Yes! yes! it was coming death! She knew it, for it was coming
      upon her also! She felt it coming! What was she about to grow into?
      Something beautiful, like the creature in her lap? It might be! Anyhow, it
      must be death; for all her strength was going out of her, while all around
      her was growing so light she could not bear it! She must be blind soon!
      Would she be blind or dead first?
    </p>
    <p>
      For the sun was rushing up behind her. Photogen woke, lifted his head from
      her lap, and sprang to his feet. His face was one radiant smile. His heart
      was full of daring&mdash;that of the hunter who will creep into the
      tiger's den. Nycteris gave a cry, covered her face with her hands, and
      pressed her eyelids close. Then blindly she stretched out her arms to
      Photogen, crying, "Oh, I am so frightened! What is this? It must be death!
      I don't wish to die yet. I love this room and the old lamp. I do not want
      the other place! This is terrible. I want to hide. I want to get into the
      sweet, soft, dark hands of all the other creatures. Ah me! ah me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is the matter with you, girl?" said Photogen, with the arrogance of
      all male creatures until they have been taught by the other kind. He stood
      looking down upon her over his bow, of which he was examining the string.
      "There is no fear of anything now, child. It is day. The sun is all but
      up. Look! he will be above the brow of yon hill in one moment more!
      Good-bye. Thank you for my night's lodging. I'm off. Don't be a goose. If
      ever I can do anything for you&mdash;and all that, you know!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't leave me; oh, don't leave me!" cried Nycteris. "I am dying! I am
      dying! I cannot move. The light sucks all the strength out of me. And oh,
      I am so frightened!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But already Photogen had splashed through the river, holding high his bow
      that it might not get wet. He rushed across the level, and strained up the
      opposing hill. Hearing no answer, Nycteris removed her hands. Photogen had
      reached the top, and the same moment the sunrays alighted upon him: the
      glory of the king of day crowded blazing upon the golden-haired youth.
      Radiant as Apollo, he stood in mighty strength, a flashing shape in the
      midst of flame. He fitted a glowing arrow to a gleaming bow. The arrow
      parted with a keen musical twang of the bowstring, and Photogen darting
      after it, vanished with a shout. Up shot Apollo himself, and from his
      quiver scattered astonishment and exultation. But the brain of poor
      Nycteris was pierced through and through. She fell down in utter darkness.
      All around her was a flaming furnace. In despair and feebleness and agony,
      she crept back, feeling her way with doubt and difficulty and enforced
      persistence to her cell. When at last the friendly darkness of her chamber
      folded her about with its cooling and consoling arms, she threw herself on
      her bed and fell fast asleep. And there she slept on, one alive in a tomb,
      while Photogen, above in the sun-glory, pursued the buffaloes on the lofty
      plain, thinking not once of her where she lay dark and forsaken, whose
      presence had been his refuge, her eyes and her hands his guardians through
      the night. He was in his glory and his pride; and the darkness and its
      disgrace had vanished for a time.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV. THE COWARD HERO.
    </h2>
    <p>
      But no sooner had the sun reached the noonstead, than Photogen began to
      remember the past night in the shadow of that which was at hand, and to
      remember it with shame. He had proved himself&mdash;and not to himself
      only, but to a girl as well&mdash;a coward!&mdash;one bold in the
      daylight, while there was nothing to fear, but trembling like any slave
      when the night arrived. There was, there must be, something unfair in it!
      A spell had been cast upon him! He had eaten, he had drunk something that
      did not agree with courage! In any case he had been taken unprepared! How
      was he to know what the going down of the sun would be like? It was no
      wonder he should have been surprised into terror, seeing it was what it
      was&mdash;in its very nature so terrible! Also, one could not see where
      danger might be coming from! You might be torn in pieces, carried off, or
      swallowed up, without even seeing where to strike a blow! Every possible
      excuse he caught at, eager as a self-lover to lighten his self-contempt.
      That day he astonished the huntsmen&mdash;terrified them with his reckless
      darings&mdash;all to prove to himself he was no coward. But nothing eased
      his shame. One thing only had hope in it&mdash;the resolve to encounter
      the dark in solemn earnest, now that he knew something of what it was. It
      was nobler to meet a recognized danger than to rush contemptuously into
      what seemed nothing&mdash;nobler still to encounter a nameless horror. He
      could conquer fear and wipe out disgrace together. For a marksman and
      swordsman like him, he said, one with his strength and courage, there was
      but danger. Defeat there was not. He knew the darkness now, and when it
      came he would meet it as fearless and cool as now he felt himself. And
      again he said, "We shall see!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood under the boughs of a great beech as the sun was going down, far
      away over the jagged hills: before it was half down, he was trembling like
      one of the leaves behind him in the first sigh of the night-wind. The
      moment the last of the glowing disc vanished, he bounded away in terror to
      gain the valley, and his fear grew as he ran. Down the side of the hill,
      an abject creature, he went bounding and rolling and running; fell rather
      than plunged into the river, and came to himself, as before, lying on the
      grassy bank in the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when he opened his eyes, there were no girl-eyes looking down into
      his; there were only the stars in the waste of the sunless Night&mdash;the
      awful all-enemy he had again dared, but could not encounter. Perhaps the
      girl was not yet come out of the water! He would try to sleep, for he
      dared not move, and perhaps when he woke he would find his head on her
      lap, and the beautiful dark face, with its deep blue eyes, bending over
      him. But when he woke he found his head on the grass, and although he
      sprang up with all his courage, such as it was, restored, he did not set
      out for the chase with such an <i>elan</i> as the day before; and, despite
      the sun-glory in his heart and veins, his hunting was this day less eager;
      he ate little, and from the first was thoughtful even to sadness. A second
      time he was defeated and disgraced! Was his courage nothing more than the
      play of the sunlight on his brain? Was he a mere ball tossed between the
      light and the dark? Then what a poor contemptible creature he was! But a
      third chance lay before him. If he failed the third time, he dared not
      foreshadow what he must then think of himself! It was bad enough now&mdash;but
      then!
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas! it went no better. The moment the sun was down, he fled as if from a
      legion of devils.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seven times in all, he tried to face the coming night in the strength of
      the past day, and seven times he failed&mdash;failed with such increase of
      failure, with such a growing sense of ignominy, overwhelming at length all
      the sunny hours and joining night to night, that, what with misery,
      self-accusation, and loss of confidence, his daylight courage too began to
      fade, and at length, from exhaustion, from getting wet, and then lying out
      of doors all night, and night after night,&mdash;worst of all, from the
      consuming of the deathly fear, and the shame of shame, his sleep forsook
      him, and on the seventh morning, instead of going to the hunt, he crawled
      into the castle, and went to bed. The grand health, over which the witch
      had taken such pains, had yielded, and in an hour or two he was moaning
      and crying out in delirium.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI. AN EVIL NURSE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Watho was herself ill, as I have said, and was the worse tempered; and,
      besides, it is a peculiarity of witches, that what works in others to
      sympathy, works in them to repulsion. Also, Watho had a poor, helpless,
      rudimentary spleen of a conscience left, just enough to make her
      uncomfortable, and therefore more wicked. So, when she heard that Photogen
      was ill, she was angry. Ill, indeed! after all she had done to saturate
      him with the life of the system, with the solar might itself! He was a
      wretched failure, the boy! And because he was <i>her</i> failure, she was
      annoyed with him, began to dislike him, grew to hate him. She looked on
      him as a painter might upon a picture, or a poet, upon a poem, which he
      had only succeeded in getting into an irrecoverable mess. In the hearts of
      witches, love and hate lie close together, and often tumble over each
      other. And whether it was that her failure with Photogen foiled also her
      plans in regard to Nycteris, or that her illness made her yet more of a
      devil's wife, certainly Watho now got sick of the girl too, and hated to
      know her about the castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was not too ill, however, to go to poor Photogen's room and torment
      him. She told him she hated him like a serpent, and hissed like one as she
      said it, looking very sharp in the nose and chin, and flat in the
      forehead. Photogen thought she meant to kill him, and hardly ventured to
      take anything brought him. She ordered every ray of light to be shut out
      of his room; but by means of this he got a little used to the darkness.
      She would take one of his arrows, and now tickle him with the feather end
      of it, now prick him with the point till the blood ran down. What she
      meant finally I cannot tell, but she brought Photogen speedily to the
      determination of making his escape from the castle: what he should do then
      he would think afterwards. Who could tell but he might find his mother
      somewhere beyond the forest! If it were not for the broad patches of
      darkness that divided day from day, he would fear nothing!
    </p>
    <p>
      But now, as he lay helpless in the dark, ever and anon would come dawning
      through it the face of the lovely creature who on that first awful night
      nursed him so sweetly: was he never to see her again? If she was, as he
      had concluded, the nymph of the river, why had she not re-appeared? She
      might have taught him not to fear the night, for plainly she had no fear
      of it herself! But then, when the day came, she did seem frightened:&mdash;why
      was that, seeing there was nothing to be afraid of then? Perhaps one so
      much at home in the darkness, was correspondingly afraid of the light!
      Then his selfish joy at the rising of the sun, blinding him to her
      condition, had made him behave to her, in ill return for her kindness, as
      cruelly as Watho behaved to him! How sweet and dear and lovely she was! If
      there were wild beasts that came out only at night, and were afraid of the
      light, why should there not be girls too, made the same way&mdash;who
      could not endure the light, as he could not bear the darkness? If only he
      could find her again! Ah, how differently he would behave to her! But
      alas! perhaps the sun had killed her&mdash;melted her&mdash;burned her up!&mdash;dried
      her up&mdash;that was it, if she was the nymph of the river!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      WATHO'S WOLF.
    </h3>
    <p>
      From that dreadful morning Nycteris had never got to be herself again. The
      sudden light had been almost death to her; and now she lay in the dark
      with the memory of a terrific sharpness&mdash;a something she dared
      scarcely recall, lest the very thought of it should sting her beyond
      endurance. But this was as nothing to the pain which the recollection of
      the rudeness of the shining creature whom she had nursed through his fear
      caused her; for, the moment his suffering passed over to her, and he was
      free, the first use he made of his returning strength had been to scorn
      her! She wondered and wondered; it was all beyond her comprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before long, Watho was plotting evil against her. The witch was like a
      sick child weary of his toy: she would pull her to pieces, and see how she
      liked it. She would set her in the sun, and see her die, like a jelly from
      the salt ocean cast out on a hot rock. It would be a sight to soothe her
      wolf-pain. One day, therefore, a little before noon, while Nycteris was in
      her deepest sleep, she had a darkened litter brought to the door, and in
      that she made two of her men carry her to the plain above. There they took
      her out, laid her on the grass, and left her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Watho watched it all from the top of her high tower, through her
      telescope; and scarcely was Nycteris left, when she saw her sit up, and
      the same moment cast herself down again with her face to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She'll have a sunstroke," said Watho, "and that'll be the end of her."
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, tormented by a fly, a huge-humped buffalo, with great shaggy
      mane, came galloping along, straight for where she lay. At sight of the
      thing on the grass, he started, swerved yards aside, stopped dead, and
      then came slowly up, looking malicious. Nycteris lay quite still, and
      never even saw the animal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now she'll be trodden to death!" said Watho. "That's the way those
      creatures do."
    </p>
    <p>
      When the buffalo reached her, he sniffed at her all over, and went away;
      then came back, and sniffed again; then all at once went off as if a demon
      had him by the tail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next came a gnu, a more dangerous animal still, and did much the same;
      then a gaunt wild boar. But no creature hurt her, and Watho was angry with
      the whole creation.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, in the shade of her hair, the blue eyes of Nycteris began to
      come to themselves a little, and the first thing they saw was a comfort. I
      have told already how she knew the night-daisies, each a sharp-pointed
      little cone with a red tip; and once she had parted the rays of one of
      them, with trembling fingers, for she was afraid she was dreadfully rude,
      and perhaps was hurting it; but she did want, she said to herself, to see
      what secret it carried so carefully hidden; and she found its golden
      heart. But now, right under her eyes, inside the veil of her hair, in the
      sweet twilight of whose blackness she could see it perfectly, stood a
      daisy with its red tip opened wide into a carmine ring, displaying its
      heart of gold on a platter of silver. She did not at first recognize it as
      one of those cones come awake, but a moment's notice revealed what it was.
      Who then could have been so cruel to the lovely little creature, as to
      force it open like that, and spread it heart-bare to the terrible
      death-lamp? Whoever it was, it must be the same that had thrown her out
      there to be burned to death in its fire! But she had her hair, and could
      hang her head, and make a small sweet night of her own about her! She
      tried to bend the daisy down and away from the sun, and to make its petals
      hang about it like her hair, but she could not. Alas! it was burned and
      dead already! She did not know that it could not yield to her gentle force
      because it was drinking life, with all the eagerness of life, from what
      she called the death-lamp. Oh, how the lamp burned her!
    </p>
    <p>
      But she went on thinking&mdash;she did not know how; and by and by began
      to reflect that, as there was no roof to the room except that in which the
      great fire went rolling about, the little Red-tip must have seen the lamp
      a thousand times, and must know it quite well! and it had not killed it!
      Nay, thinking about farther, she began to ask the question whether this,
      in which she now saw it, might not be its more perfect condition. For not
      only now did the whole seem perfect, as indeed it did before, but every
      part showed its own individual perfection as well, which perfection made
      it capable of combining with the rest into the higher perfection of a
      whole. The flower was a lamp itself! The golden heart was the light, and
      the silver border was the alabaster globe, skilfully broken, and spread
      wide to let out the glory. Yes; the radiant shape was plainly its
      perfection! If, then, it was the lamp which had opened it into that shape,
      the lamp could not be unfriendly to it, but must be of its own kind,
      seeing it made it perfect! And again, when she thought of it, there was
      clearly no little resemblance between them. What if the flower then was
      the little great-grandchild of the lamp, and he was loving it all the
      time? And what if the lamp did not mean to hurt her, only could not help
      it? The red lips looked as if the flower had some time or other been hurt:
      what if the lamp was making the best it could of her&mdash;opening her out
      somehow like the flower? She would bear it patiently, and see. But how
      coarse the colour of the grass was! Perhaps, however, her eyes not being
      made for the bright lamp, she did not see them us they were! Then she
      remembered how different were the eyes of the creature that was not a girl
      and was afraid of the darkness! Ah, if the darkness would only come again,
      all arms, friendly and soft everywhere about her! She would wait and wait,
      and bear, and be patient.
    </p>
    <p>
      She lay so still that Watho did not doubt she had fainted. She was pretty
      sure she would be dead before the night came to revive her.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII. REFUGE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Fixing her telescope on the motionless form, that she might see it at once
      when the morning came, Watho went down from the tower to Photogen's room.
      He was much better by this time, and before she left him, he had resolved
      to leave the castle that very night. The darkness was terrible indeed, but
      Watho was worse than even the darkness, and he could not escape in the
      day. As soon, therefore, as the house seemed still, he tightened his belt,
      hung to it his hunting-knife, put a flask of wine and some bread in his
      pocket, and took his bow and arrows. He got from the house, and made his
      way at once up to the plain. But what with his illness, the terrors of the
      night, and his dread of the wild beasts, when he got to the level he could
      not walk a step further, and sat down, thinking it better to die than to
      live. In spite of his fears, however, sleep contrived to overcome him, and
      he fell at full length on the soft grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not slept long when he woke with such a strange sense of comfort
      and security, that he thought the dawn at least must have arrived. But it
      was dark night about him. And the sky&mdash;no, it was not the sky, but
      the blue eyes of his naiad looking down upon him! Once more he lay with
      his head in her lap, and all was well, for plainly the girl feared the
      darkness as little as he the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you," he said. "You are like live armour to my heart; you keep the
      fear off me. I have been very ill since then. Did you come up out of the
      river when you saw me cross?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't live in the water," she answered. "I live under the pale lamp,
      and I die under the bright one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, yes! I understand now," he returned. "I would not have behaved as I
      did last time if I had understood; but I thought you were mocking me; and
      I am so made that I cannot help being frightened at the darkness. I beg
      your pardon for leaving you as I did, for, as I say, I did not understand.
      Now I believe you were really frightened. Were you not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was, indeed," answered Nycteris, "and shall be again. But why you
      should be, I cannot in the least understand. You must know how gentle and
      sweet the darkness is, how kind and friendly, how soft and velvety! It
      holds you to its bosom and loves you. A little while ago, I lay faint and
      dying under your hot lamp.&mdash;What is it you call it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The sun," murmured Photogen: "how I wish he would make haste!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! do not wish that. Do not, for my sake, hurry him. I can take care of
      you from the darkness, but I have no one to take care of me from the
      light.&mdash;As I was telling you, I lay dying in the sun. All at once I
      drew a deep breath. A cool wind came and ran over my face. I looked up.
      The torture was gone, for the death-lamp itself was gone. I hope he does
      not die and grow brighter yet. My terrible headache was all gone, and my
      sight was come back. I felt as if I were new made. But I did not get up at
      once, for I was tired still. The grass grew cool about me, and turned soft
      in colour. Something wet came upon it, and it was now so pleasant to my
      feet, that I rose and ran about. And when I had been running about a long
      time, all at once I found you lying, just as I had been lying a little
      while before. So I sat down beside you to take care of you, till your life&mdash;and
      my death&mdash;should come again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How good you are, you beautiful creature!&mdash;Why, you forgave me
      before ever I asked you!" cried Photogen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus they fell a talking, and he told her what he knew of his history, and
      she told him what she knew of hers, and they agreed they must get away
      from Watho as far as ever they could.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And we must set out at once," said Nycteris.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The moment the morning comes," returned Photogen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We must not wait for the morning," said Nycteris, "for then I shall not
      be able to move, and what would you do the next night? Besides, Watho sees
      best in the daytime. Indeed, you must come now, Photogen.&mdash;You must."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can not; I dare not," said Photogen. "I cannot move. If I but lift my
      head from your lap, the very sickness of terror seizes me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall be with you," said Nycteris soothingly. "I will take care of you
      till your dreadful sun comes, and then you may leave me, and go away as
      fast as you can. Only please put me in a dark place first, if there is one
      to be found."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will never leave you again, Nycteris," cried Photogen. "Only wait till
      the sun comes, and brings me back my strength, and we will go away
      together, and never, never part any more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no," persisted Nycteris; "we must go now. And you must learn to be
      strong in the dark as well as in the day, else you will always be only
      half brave. I have begun already&mdash;not to fight your sun, but to try
      to get at peace with him, and understand what he really is, and what he
      means with me&mdash;whether to hurt me or to make the best of me. You must
      do the same with my darkness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you don't know what mad animals there are away there towards the
      south," said Photogen. "They have huge green eyes, and they would eat you
      up like a bit of celery, you beautiful creature!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, come! you must," said Nycteris, "or I shall have to pretend to
      leave you, to make you come. I have seen the green eyes you speak of, and
      I will take care of you from them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You! How can you do that? If it were day now, I could take care of you
      from the worst of them. But as it is, I can't even see them for this
      abominable darkness. I could not see your lovely eyes but for the light
      that is in them; that lets me see straight into heaven through them. They
      are windows into the very heaven beyond the sky. I believe they are the
      very place where the stars are made."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You come then, or I shall shut them," said Nycteris, "and you shan't see
      them any more till you are good. Come. If you can't see the wild beasts, I
      can."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can! and you ask me to come!" cried Photogen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," answered Nycteris. "And more than that, I see them long before they
      can see me, so that I am able to take care of you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how?" persisted Photogen. "You can't shoot with bow and arrow, or
      stab with a hunting-knife."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, but I can keep out of the way of them all. Why, just when I found
      you, I was having a game with two or three of them at once. I see, and
      scent them too, long before they are near me&mdash;long before they can
      see or scent me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't see or scent any now, do you?" said Photogen, uneasily, rising
      on his elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No&mdash;none at present. I will look," replied Nycteris, and sprang to
      her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, oh! do not leave me&mdash;not for a moment," cried Photogen,
      straining his eyes to keep her face in sight through the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be quiet, or they will hear you," she returned. "The wind is from the
      south, and they cannot scent us. I have found out all about that. Ever
      since the dear dark came, I have been amusing myself with them, getting
      every now and then just into the edge of the wind, and letting one have a
      sniff of me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, horrible!" cried Photogen. "I hope you will not insist on doing so
      any more. What was the consequence?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Always, the very instant, he turned with flashing eyes, and hounded
      towards me&mdash;only he could not see me, you must remember. But my eyes
      being so much better than his, I could see him perfectly well, and would
      run away round him until I scented him, and then I knew he could not find
      me anyhow. If the wind were to turn, and run the other way now, there
      might be a whole army of them down upon us, leaving no room to keep out of
      their way. You had better come."
    </p>
    <p>
      She took him by the hand. He yielded and rose, and she led him away. But
      his steps were feeble, and as the night went on, he seemed more and more
      ready to sink.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh dear! I am so tired! and so frightened!" he would say.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lean on me," Nycteris would return, putting her arm round him, or patting
      his cheek. "Take a few steps more. Every step away from the castle is
      clear gain. Lean harder on me. I am quite strong and well now."
    </p>
    <p>
      So they went on. The piercing night-eyes of Nycteris descried not a few
      pairs of green ones gleaming like holes in the darkness, and many a round
      she made to keep far out of their way; but she never said to Photogen she
      saw them. Carefully she kept him off the uneven places, and on the softest
      and smoothest of the grass, talking to him gently all the way as they went&mdash;of
      the lovely flowers and the stars&mdash;how comfortable the flowers looked,
      down in their green beds, and how happy the stars up in their blue beds!
    </p>
    <p>
      When the morning began to come, he began to grow better, but was
      dreadfully tired with walking instead of sleeping, especially after being
      so long ill. Nycteris too, what with supporting him, what with growing
      fear of the light which was beginning to ooze out of the east, was very
      tired. At length, both equally exhausted, neither was able to help the
      other. As if by consent they stopped. Embracing each the other, they stood
      in the midst of the wide grassy land, neither of them able to move a step,
      each supported only by the leaning weakness of the other, each ready to
      fall if the other should move. But while the one grew weaker still, the
      other had begun to grow stronger. When the tide of the night began to ebb,
      the tide of the day began to flow; and now the sun was rushing to the
      horizon, borne upon its foaming billows. And ever as he came, Photogen
      revived. At last the sun shot up into the air, like a bird from the hand
      of the Father of Lights. Nycteris gave a cry of pain, and hid her face in
      her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh me!" she sighed; "I am <i>so</i> frightened! The terrible light stings
      so!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But the same instant, through her blindness, she heard Photogen give a low
      exultant laugh, and the next felt herself caught up: she who all night
      long had tended and protected him like a child, was now in his arms, borne
      along like a baby, with her head lying on his shoulder. But she was the
      greater, for, suffering more, she feared nothing.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX. THE WEREWOLF.
    </h2>
    <p>
      At the very moment when Photogen caught up Nycteris, the telescope of
      Watho was angrily sweeping the table-land. She swung it from her in rage,
      and running to her room, shut herself up. There she anointed herself from
      top to toe with a certain ointment; shook down her long red hair, and tied
      it round her waist; then began to dance, whirling round and round faster
      and faster, growing angrier and angrier, until she was foaming at the
      mouth with fury. When Falca went looking for her, she could not find her
      anywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the sun rose, the wind slowly changed and went round, until it blew
      straight from the north. Photogen and Nycteris were drawing near the edge
      of the forest, Photogen still carrying Nycteris, when she moved a little
      on his shoulder uneasily, and murmured in his ear,
    </p>
    <p>
      "I smell a wild beast&mdash;that way, the way the wind is coming."
    </p>
    <p>
      Photogen turned, looked back towards the castle, and saw a dark speck on
      the plain. As he looked, it grew larger: it was coming across the grass
      with the speed of the wind. It came nearer and nearer. It looked long and
      low, but that might be because it was running at a great stretch. He set
      Nycteris down under a tree, in the black shadow of its bole, strung his
      bow, and picked out his heaviest, longest, sharpest arrow. Just as he set
      the notch on the string, he saw that the creature was a tremendous wolf,
      rushing straight at him. He loosened his knife in its sheath, drew another
      arrow half-way from the quiver, lest the first should fail, and took his
      aim&mdash;at a good distance, to leave time for a second chance. He shot.
      The arrow rose, flew straight, descended, struck the beast, and started
      again into the air, doubled like a letter V. Quickly Photogen snatched the
      other, shot, cast his bow from him, and drew his knife. But the arrow was
      in the brute's chest, up to the feather; it tumbled heels over head with a
      great thud of its back on the earth, gave a groan, made a struggle or two,
      and lay stretched out motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've killed it, Nycteris," cried Photogen. "It is a great red wolf."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, thank you!" answered Nycteris feebly from behind the tree. "I was
      sure you would. I was not a bit afraid."
    </p>
    <p>
      Photogen went up to the wolf. It <i>was</i> a monster! But he was vexed
      that his first arrow had behaved so badly, and was the less willing to
      lose the one that had done him such good service: with a long and a strong
      pull, he drew it from the brute's chest. Could he believe his eyes? There
      lay&mdash;no wolf, but Watho, with her hair tied round her waist! The
      foolish witch had made herself invulnerable, as she supposed, but had
      forgotten that, to torment Photogen therewith, she had handled one of his
      arrows. He ran back to Nycteris and told her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shuddered and wept, and would not look.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX. ALL IS WELL.
    </h2>
    <p>
      There was now no occasion to fly a step farther. Neither of them feared
      any one but Watho. They left her there, and went back. A great cloud came
      over the sun, and rain began to fall heavily, and Nycteris was much
      refreshed, grew able to see a little, and with Photogen's help walked
      gently over the cool wet grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had not gone far before they met Fargu and the other huntsmen.
      Photogen told them he had killed a great red wolf, and it was Madam Watho.
      The huntsmen looked grave, but gladness shone through.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then," said Fargu, "I will go and bury my mistress."
    </p>
    <p>
      But when they reached the place, they found she was already buried&mdash;in
      the maws of sundry birds and beasts which had made their breakfast of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Fargu, overtaking them, would, very wisely, have Photogen go to the
      king, and tell him the whole story. But Photogen, yet wiser than Fargu,
      would not set out until he had married Nycteris; "for then," he said, "the
      king himself can't part us; and if ever two people couldn't do the one
      without the other, those two are Nycteris and I. She has got to teach me
      to be a brave man in the dark, and I have got to look after her until she
      can bear the heat of the sun, and he helps her to see, instead of blinding
      her."
    </p>
    <p>
      They were married that very day. And the next day they went together to
      the king, and told him the whole story. But whom should they find at the
      court but the father and mother of Photogen, both in high favour with the
      king and queen. Aurora nearly died for joy, and told them all how Watho
      had lied, and made her believe her child was dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one knew anything of the father or mother of Nycteris; but when Aurora,
      saw in the lovely girl her own azure eyes shining through night and its
      clouds, it made her think strange things, and wonder how even the wicked
      themselves may be a link to join together the good. Through Watho, the
      mothers, who had never seen each other, had changed eyes in their
      children.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king gave them the castle and lands of Watho, and there they lived and
      taught each other for many years that were not long. But hardly had one of
      them passed, before Nycteris had come to love the day best, because it was
      the clothing and crown of Photogen, and she saw that the day was greater
      than the night, and the sun more lordly than the moon; and Photogen had
      come to love the night best, because it was the mother and home of
      Nycteris.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But who knows," Nycteris would say to Photogen, "that, when we go out, we
      shall not go into a day as much greater than your day as your day is
      greater than my night?"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. HUSBAND AND WIFE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I am going to tell a story of married life. My title will prepare the
      reader for something hardly heroic; but I trust it will not be found
      lacking in the one genuine and worthy interest a tale ought to have&mdash;namely,
      that it presents a door through which we may walk into one region or
      another of the human heart, and there find ourselves not altogether
      unacquainted or from home.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a law among the Jews which forbade the yoking together of
      certain animals, either because, being unequal in size or strength, one of
      them must be oppressed, or for the sake of some lesson thus embodied to
      the Eastern mind&mdash;possibly for both reasons. Half the tragedy would
      be taken out of social life if this law could be applied to human beings
      in their various relations. I do not say that this would be well, or that
      we could afford to lose the result of the tragedy thus occasioned. Neither
      do I believe that there are so many instances of unequal yoking as the
      misprising judgments of men by men and women by women might lead us to
      imagine. Not every one declared by the wisdom of acquaintance to have
      thrown himself or herself away must therefore be set down as unequally
      yoked. Or it may even be that the inequality is there, but the loss on the
      other side. How some people could ever have come together must always be a
      puzzle until one knows the history of the affair; but not a few whom most
      of us would judge quite unsuited to each other do yet get on pretty well
      from, the first, and better and better the longer they are together, and
      that with mutual advantage, improvement, and development. Essential
      humanity is deeper than the accidents of individuality; the common is more
      powerful than the peculiar; and the honest heart will always be learning
      to act more and more in accordance with the laws of its being. It must be
      of much more consequence to any lady that her husband should be a man on
      whose word she can depend than that he should be of a gracious presence.
      But if instead of coming nearer to a true understanding of each other, the
      two should from the first keep falling asunder, then something tragic may
      almost be looked for.

      Duncan and Lucy Dempster were a couple the very mention of whose Christian
      names together would have seemed amusing to the friends who had long
      ceased to talk of their unfitness. Indeed, I doubt if in their innermost
      privacy they ever addressed each other except as Mr. and Mrs. Dempster.
      For the first time to see them together, no one could help wondering how
      the conjunction could have been effected. Dempster was of Scotch descent,
      but the hereditary high cheek-bone seemed to have got into his nose, which
      was too heavy a pendant for the low forehead from which it hung. About an
      inch from the end it took a swift and unexpected curve downwards, and was
      a curious and abnormal nose, which could not properly be assorted with any
      known class of noses. A long upper lip, a large, firm, and not quite ugly
      mouth, with a chin both long and square, completed a face which, with its
      low forehead, being yet longer than usual, had a particularly equine look.
      He was rather under the middle height, slender, and well enough made&mdash;altogether
      an ordinary mortal, known on 'Change as an able, keen, and laborious man
      of business. What his special business was I do not know. He went to the
      city by the eight o'clock omnibus every morning, dived into a court,
      entered a little square, rushed up two flights of stairs to a couple of
      rooms, and sat down in the back one before an office table on a
      hair-seated chair. It was a dingy place&mdash;not so dirty as it looked, I
      daresay. Even the windows, being of bad glass, did, I believe, look
      dirtier than they were. It was a place where, so far as the eye of an
      outsider could tell, much or nothing might be doing. Its occupant always
      wore his hat in it, and his hat always looked shabby. Some people said he
      was rich, others that he would be one day. Some said he was a responsible
      man, whatever the epithet may have been intended to mean. I believe he was
      quite as honest as the recognized laws of his trade demanded&mdash;and for
      how many could I say more? Nobody said he was avaricious&mdash;but then he
      moved amongst men whose very notion was first to make money, after that to
      be religious, or to enjoy themselves, as the case might be. And no one
      either ever said of him that he was a good man, or a generous. He was
      about forty years of age, looking somehow as if he had never been younger.
      He had had a fair education&mdash;better than is generally considered
      necessary for mercantile purposes&mdash;but it would have been hard to
      discover any signs of it in the spending of his leisure. On Sunday
      mornings he went with his wife to church, and when he came home had a good
      dinner, of which now and then a friend took his share. If no stranger was
      present he took his wine by himself, and went to sleep in his easy chair
      of marone-coloured leather, while his wife sat on the other side of the
      fire if it was winter, or a little way off by the open window if it was
      summer, gently yawned now and then, and looked at him with eyes a little
      troubled. Then he went off again by the eight o'clock omnibus on Monday
      morning, and not an idea more or less had he in his head, not a
      hair's-breadth of difference was there in his conduct or pursuits, that he
      had been to church and had spent the day out of business. That may,
      however, for anything I know, have been as much the clergyman's fault as
      his. He was the sort of man you might call machine-made, one in whom
      humanity, if in no wise caricatured, was yet in no wise ennobled.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife was ten years younger than he&mdash;hardly less than beautiful&mdash;only
      that over her countenance seemed to have gathered a kind of haze of
      commonness. At first sight, notwithstanding, one could not help perceiving
      that she was china and he was delft. She was graceful as she sat,
      long-necked, slope-shouldered, and quite as tall as her husband, with a
      marked daintiness about her in the absence of the extremes of the fashion,
      in the quality of the lace she wore on her black silk dress, and in the
      wide white sleeves of fine cambric that covered her arms from the shoulder
      to the wrist. She had a morally delicate air, a look of scrupulous nicety
      and lavender-stored linen. She had long dark lashes; and when they rose,
      the eyelids revealed eyes of uncommon beauty. She had good features, good
      teeth, and a good complexion. The main feeling she produced and left was
      of ladyhood&mdash;little more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sunday afternoon came fifty-two times in the year. I mention this because
      then always, and nearly then only, could one calculate on seeing them
      together. It came to them in a surburb of London, and the look of it was
      dull. Doubtless Mr. Dempster's dinner and his repose after it were
      interesting to him, but I cannot help thinking his wife found it dreary.
      She had, however, got used to it. The house was a good old one, of red
      brick, much larger than they required, but not expensive, and had a
      general look of the refinement of its mistress. In the summer the windows
      of the dining-room would generally be open, for they looked into a really
      lovely garden behind the house, and the scent of the jasmine that crept
      all around them would come in plentifully. I wonder what the scent of
      jasmine did in Duncan Dempster's world. Perhaps it never got farther than
      the general ante-chamber of the sensorium. It often made his wife sad&mdash;she
      could not tell why. To him I daresay it smelt agreeable, but I can hardly
      believe it ever woke in him that dreamy sensation it gave her&mdash;of
      something she had not had enough of, she could not say what. When the heat
      was gone off a little he would walk out on the lawn, which was well kept
      and well watered, with many flowering shrubs about it. Why he did so, I
      cannot tell. He looked at nothing in particular, only walked about for a
      few minutes, no doubt derived some pleasure of a mild nature from
      something, and walked in again to tea. One might have expected he would
      have cultivated the acquaintance of his garden a little, if it were only
      for the pleasure the contrast would give him when he got back to his loved
      office, for a greater contrast could not well have been found than between
      his dingy dreary haunt on weekdays&mdash;a place which nothing but duty
      could have made other than repugnant to any free soul&mdash;and this nest
      of greenery and light and odour. Sweet scents floated in clouds invisible
      about the place; flower eyes and stars and bells and bunches shone and
      glowed and lurked all around; his very feet might have learned a lesson of
      that which is beyond the sense from the turf he trod; but all the time, if
      he were not exactly seeing in his mind's eye the walls and tables of his
      office in the City square, his thoughts were not the less brooding over
      such business as he there transacted. For Mr. Dempster's was not a free
      soul. How could it be when all his energies were given to making money?
      This he counted his <i>calling</i>&mdash;and I believe actually contrived
      to associate some feeling of duty with the notion of leaving behind him a
      plump round sum of money, as if money in accumulation and following flood,
      instead of money in peaceful current, were the good thing for the world!
      Hence the whole realm of real life, the universe of thought and growth,
      was a high-hedged park to him, within which he never even tried to look&mdash;not
      even knowing that he was shut out from it, for the hedge was of his own
      growing. What shall ever wake such a man to a sense of indwelling poverty,
      or make him begin to hunger after any lowliest expansion? Does a reader
      retort, "The man was comfortable, and why should he be troubled?" If the
      end of being, I answer, is only comfort in self, I yield. But what if
      there should be at the heart of the universe a Thought to which the being
      of such men is distasteful? What if to that Thought they look blots in
      light, ugly things? May there not lie in that direction some possible
      reason why they should bethink themselves? Dempster, however, was not yet
      a clinker out of which all the life was burned, however much he looked
      like one. There was in him that which might yet burn&mdash;and give light
      and heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the Sunday evenings Mrs. Dempster would have gladly gone to church
      again, if only&mdash;though to herself she never allowed this for one of
      her reasons&mdash;to slip from under the weight of her husband's presence.
      He seldom spoke to her more than a sentence at a time, but he did like to
      have her near him, and I suppose held, through the bare presence, some
      kind of dull one-sided communication with her; what did a woman know about
      business? and what did he know about except business? It is true he had a
      rudimentary pleasure in music&mdash;and would sometimes ask her to play to
      him, when he would listen, and after his fashion enjoy. But although here
      was a gift that might be developed until his soul could echo the music of
      the spheres, the embodied souls of Handel or Mendelssohn were to him but
      clouds of sound wrapped about kernels&mdash;let me say of stock or bonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a year or so after their marriage it had been the custom that, the
      first thing after breakfast on Monday morning, she should bring him her
      account-book, that they might together go over her week's expenses. She
      must cultivate the business habits in which, he said, he found her more
      than deficient. How could he endure in a wife what would have been
      preposterous in a clerk, and would have led to his immediate dismissal? It
      was in his eyes necessary that the same strict record of receipt and
      expenditure should be kept in the household as in the office; how else was
      one to know in what direction things were going? he said. He required of
      his wife, therefore, that every individual thing that cost money, even to
      what she spent upon her own person, should be entered in her book. She had
      no money of her own, neither did he allow her any special sum for her
      private needs; but he made her a tolerably liberal weekly allowance, from
      which she had to pay everything except house-rent and taxes, an
      arrangement which I cannot believe a good one, as it will inevitably lead
      some conscientious wives to self-denial severer than necessary, and on the
      other hand will tempt the vulgar nature to make a purse for herself by
      mean savings off everybody else. It was especially distasteful to Mrs.
      Dempster to have to set down every little article of personal requirement
      that she bought. It would probably have seemed to her but a trifle had
      they both been young when they married, and had there been that tenderness
      of love between them which so soon sets everything more than right; but as
      it was, she could never get over the feeling that the man was strange to
      her. As it was she would have got over this. But there was in her a
      certain constitutional lack of precision, combined with a want of energy
      and a weakness of will, that rendered her more than careless where her
      liking was not interested. Hence, while she would have been horrified at
      playing a wrong note or singing out of tune, she not only had no anxiety,
      for the thing's own sake, to have her accounts correct, but shrunk from
      every effort in that direction. Now I can perfectly understand her recoil
      from the whole affair, with her added dislike to the smallness of the
      thing required of her; but seeing she did begin with doing it after a
      fashion, it is not so easy to understand why, doing it, she should not
      make a consolation of doing it with absolute exactness. Not even her dread
      of her husband's dissatisfaction&mdash;which was by no means small&mdash;could
      prevail to make her, instead of still trusting a memory that constantly
      played her false, put down a thing at once, nor postpone it to a far less
      convenient season. Hence it came that her accounts, though never much out,
      never balanced; and the weekly audit, while it grew more and more irksome
      to the one, grew more and more unsatisfactory to the other. For to Mr.
      Dempster's dusty eyes exactitude wore the robe of rectitude, and before
      long, precisely and merely from the continued unsatisfactory condition of
      her accounts, he began, in a hidden corner of his righteous soul, to
      reflect on the moral condition of his wife herself as unsatisfactory. Now
      such it certainly was, but he was not the man to judge it correctly, or to
      perceive the true significance of her failing. In business, while
      scrupulous as to the requirements of custom and recognized right, he
      nevertheless did things from which her soul would have recoiled like "the
      tender horns of cockled snails;" yet it was to him not merely a strange
      and inexplicable fact that she should <i>never</i> be able to show to a
      penny, nay, often not to a shilling or eighteenpence, how the week's
      allowance went, but a painful one as indicating something beyond
      perversity. And truly it was no very hard task he required of her, for,
      seeing they had no children, only three servants, and saw little company,
      her housekeeping could not be a very heavy or involved affair. Perhaps if
      it had been more difficult she would have done it better, but anyhow she
      hated the whole thing, procrastinated, and setting down several things
      together, was <i>sure</i> to forget some article or mistake some price;
      yet not one atom more would she distrust her memory the next time she was
      tempted. But it was a small fault at worst, and if her husband had loved
      her enough to understand the bearings of it in relation to her mental and
      moral condition he would have tried to content himself that at least she
      did not exceed her allowance; and would of all things have avoided making
      such a matter a burden upon the consciousness of one so differently
      educated, if not constituted, from himself. It is but fair to add on the
      other side that, if she had loved him after anything like a wifely ideal,
      which I confess was not yet possible to her, it would not have been many
      weeks before she had a first correct account to show him. Convinced, at
      length, that accuracy was not to be had from her, and satisfying himself
      with dissatisfaction, he one morning threw from him the little ruled book,
      and declared, in a wrath which he sought to smother into dignified but
      hopeless rebuke, that he would trouble himself with her no further. She
      burst into tears, took up the book, left the room, cried a little,
      resolved to astonish him the next Monday, and never set down another item.
      When it came, and breakfast was over, he gave her the usual cheque, and
      left at once for town. Nor had the accounts ever again been alluded to
      between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now this might have been very well, or at least not very ill, if both had
      done tolerably well thereafter&mdash;that is, if the one had continued to
      attend to her expenditure as well as before, and the other, when he threw
      away the account-book, had dismissed from his mind the whole matter. But
      Dempster was one of those dangerous men&mdash;more dangerous, however, to
      themselves than to others&mdash;who never forget, that is, get over, an
      offence or disappointment. They respect themselves so much, and, out of
      their respect for themselves, build so much upon success, set so much by
      never being defeated but always gaining their point, that when they are
      driven to confess themselves foiled, the confession is made from the "poor
      dumb mouth" of a wound that cannot be healed. It is there for ever&mdash;will
      be there at least until they find another God to worship than their own
      paltry selves. Hence it came that the bourn between the two spiritual
      estates yawned a little wider at one point, and a mist of dissatisfaction
      would not unfrequently rise from a certain stagnant pool in its hollow.
      The cause was paltry in one sense, but nothing to which belongs the name
      of <i>Cause</i> can fail to mingle the element of awfulness even with its
      paltriness. Its worst effect was that it hindered approximation in other
      parts of their marching natures.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as to Mrs. Dempster, I am sorry for the apparent justification which
      what I have to confess concerning her must give to the severe whims of
      such husbands as hers: from that very Monday morning she began to grow a
      little careless about her expenditure&mdash;which she had never been
      before. By degrees bill after bill was allowed to filch from the provision
      of the following week, and when that was devoured, then from that of the
      week after. It was not that she was in the least more expensive upon
      herself, or that she consciously wasted anything; but, altogether averse
      to housekeeping, she ceased to exercise the same outlook upon the
      expenditure of the house, did not keep her horses together, left the
      management more and more to her cook; while the consciousness that she was
      not doing her duty made her more and more uncomfortable, and the knowledge
      that things were going farther and farther wrong, made her hate the idea
      of accounts worse and worse, until she came at length to regard them with
      such a loathing as might have fitted some extreme of moral evil. The bills
      which were supposed by her husband to be regularly settled every week were
      at last months behind, and the week's money spent in meeting the most
      pressing of its demands, while what it could no longer cover was cast upon
      the growing heap of evil for the time to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must say this for her, however, that there was a small sum of money she
      expected on the death of a crazy aunt, which, if she could but lay hold of
      it without her husband's knowledge, she meant to devote to the clearing
      off of everything, when she vowed to herself to do better in the time to
      come.
    </p>
    <p>
      The worst thing in it all was that her fear of her husband kept
      increasing, and that she felt more and more uncomfortable in his presence.
      Hence that troubled look in her eye, always more marked when her husband
      sat dozing in his chair of a Sunday afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was natural, too, that, although they never quarrelled, their
      intercourse should not grow of a more tender character. Seldom was there a
      salient point in their few scattered sentences of conversation, except,
      indeed, it were some piece of news either had to communicate. Occasionally
      the wife read something from the newspaper, but never except at her
      husband's request. In general he enjoyed his newspaper over a chop at his
      office. Two or three times since their marriage&mdash;now eight years&mdash;he
      had made a transient resolve pointing at the improvement of her mind, and
      to that end had taken from his great glass-armoured bookcase some <i>standard</i>
      work&mdash;invariably, I believe, upon party-politics&mdash;from which he
      had made her read him a chapter. But, unhappily, she had always got to the
      end of it without gaining the slightest glimmer of a true notion of what
      the author was driving at.
    </p>
    <p>
      It almost moves me to pity to think of the vagueness of that rudimentary
      humanity in Mr. Dempster which made him dream of doing something to
      improve his wife's mind. What did he ever do to improve his own? It is
      hard to understand how horses find themselves so comfortable in their
      stables that, be the day ever so fine, the country ever so lovely, the air
      ever so exhilarating, they are always rejoiced to get back into their dull
      twilight: it is harder to me to understand how Mr. Dempster could be so
      comfortable in his own mind that he never wanted to get out of it, even at
      the risk of being beside himself; but no doubt the dimness of its twilight
      had a good deal to do with his content. And then there is that in every
      human mind which no man's neighbour, nay, no man himself, can understand.
      My neighbour may in his turn be regarding my mind as a gloomy place to
      live in, while I find it no undesirable residence&mdash;though chiefly
      because of the number of windows it affords me for looking out of it.
      Still, if Dempster's dingy office in the City was not altogether a
      sufficing type of the mind that used it, I consider it a very fairly good
      one.
    </p>
    <p>
      But wherein was Mrs. Dempster so very different from her husband as I
      rudely fancy some of my readers imagining her? Whatever may have been her
      reasons for marrying him&mdash;one would suppose they must have been
      weighty&mdash;to do so she must have been in a very undeveloped condition,
      and in that condition she still remained. I do not mean that she was less
      developed than ninety-nine out of the hundred: most women affect me only
      as valuable crude material out of which precious things are making. How
      much they might be, must be, shall be! For now they stand like so many
      Lot's-wives&mdash;so many rough-hewn marble blocks, rather, of which a
      Divinity is shaping the ends. Mrs. Dempster had all the making of a lovely
      woman, but notwithstanding her grace, her beauty, her sweetness, her
      lark-like ballading too, she was a very ordinary woman in that region of
      her which knew what she meant when she said "I." Of this fact she had
      hardly a suspicion, however; for until aspiration brings humility, people
      are generally pretty well satisfied with themselves, having no idea what
      poor creatures they are. She saw in her mirror a superior woman, regarded
      herself as one of the finer works of creation. The worst was that from the
      first she had counted herself superior to her husband, and in marrying him
      had felt not merely that she was conferring a favour, which every husband
      would allow, but that she was lowering herself without elevating him. Now
      it is true that she was pleasanter to look at, that her manners were
      sweeter, and her notions of the becoming far less easily satisfied than
      his; also that she was a little less deficient in vague reverence for
      certain forms of the higher than he. But I know of nothing in her to
      determine her classification as of greater value than he, except indeed
      that she was on the whole rather more honest. She read novels and he did
      not; she passed shallow judgment, where he scorned to judge; she read all
      the middling poetry that came in her way, and copied books full of it; but
      she could no more have appreciated one of Milton's or Shakspere's smallest
      poems than she could have laughed over a page of Chinese. She liked to
      hear this and that popular preacher, and when her husband called his
      sermons humbug, she heard it with a shocked countenance; but was she
      better or worse than her husband when, admiring them as she did, she
      permitted them to have no more influence upon her conduct than if they had
      been the merest humbug ever uttered by ambitious demagogue? In truth, I
      cannot see that in the matter of worth there was much as yet to choose
      between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is hardly necessary, then, to say that there was little appreciable
      approximation of any kind going on between them. If only they would have
      read Dickens together! Who knows what might have come of it! But this dull
      close animal proximity, without the smallest conscious nearness of heart
      or mind or soul&mdash;and so little chance, from very lack of wants, for
      showing each other kindnesses&mdash;surely it is a killing sort of thing!
      And yet, and yet, there is always a something&mdash;call it habit, or any
      poorest name you please&mdash;grows up between two who are much together,
      at least when they neither quarrel nor thwart each other's designs, which,
      tending with its roots towards the deeper human, blossoms into&mdash;a
      wretched little flower indeed, yet afar off partaking of the nature of
      love. The Something seldom reveals its existence until they are parted. I
      suspect that with not a few, Death is the love-messenger at the stroke of
      whose dart the stream of love first begins to flow in the selfish bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is now necessary to mention a little break in the monotony of Mrs.
      Dempster's life, which, but for what came afterwards, could claim no
      record. One morning her page announced Major Strong, and possibly she
      received the gentleman who entered with a brighter face than she had ever
      shown her husband. The major had just arrived from India. He had been much
      at her father's house while she was yet a mere girl, being then engaged to
      one of her sisters, who died after he went abroad, and before he could
      return to marry her. He was now a widower, a fine-looking, frank, manly
      fellow. The expression of his countenance was little altered, and the
      sight of him revived in the memory of Mrs. Dempster many recollections of
      a happy girlhood, when the prospect of such a life as she now led with
      tolerable content would have seemed simply unendurable. When her husband
      came home she told him as much as he cared to hear of the visitor she had
      had, and he made no objection to her asking him to dine the next Sunday.
      When he arrived Mr. Dempster saw a man of his own age, bronzed and big,
      with not much waist left, but a good carriage and pleasant face. He made
      himself agreeable at dinner, appreciated his host's wine, and told good
      stories that pleased the business man as showing that he knew "what was
      what." He accorded him his more particular approval, speaking to his wife,
      on the ground that he was a man of the world, with none of the army slang
      about him. Mr. Dempster was not aware that he had himself more business
      peculiarities than any officer in her majesty's service had military ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this Major Strong frequently called upon Mrs. Dempster. They were
      good friends, and did each other no harm whatever, and the husband neither
      showed nor felt the least jealousy. They sang together, occasionally went
      out shopping, and three or four times went together to the play. Mr.
      Dempster, so long as he had his usual comforts, did not pine in his wife's
      absence, but did show a little more pleasure when she came home to him
      than usually when he came home to her. This lasted for a few months. Then
      the major went back to India, and for a time the lady missed him a good
      deal, which, considering the dulness of her life, was not very surprising
      or reprehensible.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II. AN ASTONISHMENT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Now comes the strange part of my story.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening the housemaid opened the door to Mr. Dempster on his return
      from the city; and perhaps the fact that it was the maid, and not the page
      as usual, roused his observation, which, except in business matters, was
      not remarkably operative. He glanced at the young woman, when an eye far
      less keen than his could not have failed to remark a strangely excited
      expression on her countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is the boy?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just run to the doctor's, sir," she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then first he remembered that when he left in the morning his wife had not
      been feeling altogether well, but he had never thought of her since.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How is your mistress?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's rather poorly, sir, but&mdash;but&mdash;she's as well as could be
      expected."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What does the fool mean?" said Dempster to himself, and very nearly said
      it aloud, for he was not over polite to any in his service. But he did not
      say it aloud. He advanced into the hall with deliberation, and made for
      the stair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, please sir," the maid cried in a tone of perturbation, when, turning
      from shutting the door, she saw his intention, "you can't go up to
      mis'ess's room just at this minute, sir. Please go in the dining-room,
      sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean?" he asked, turning angrily upon the girl, for of all
      things he hated mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like every one else in the house, and office both, she stood in awe of
      him, and his look frightened her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please go in the dining-room," she gasped entreatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What!" he said and did turn towards the dining-room, "is your mistress so
      ill she can't see me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no, sir!&mdash;at least I don't know exactly. Cook's with her, sir.
      She's over the worst, anyhow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What on earth do you mean, girl? Speak out, will you? What is the matter
      with your mistress?"
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke he stepped into the room, the maid following him. The same
      moment he spied a whitish bundle of something on the rug in front of the
      fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean by leaving things like that in the dining-room?" he went
      on more angrily still.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please, sir," answered the girl, going and lifting the bundle carefully,
      "it's the baby!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The baby!" shouted Mr. Dempster, and looked at her from head to foot.
      "What baby?" Then bethinking himself that it must belong to some visitor
      in the drawing-room with his wife, he moderated his tone. "Make haste;
      take it away!" he said. "I don't want babies here! There's a time and a
      place for everything!&mdash;What <i>are</i> you about?"
    </p>
    <p>
      For, instead of obeying her master and taking it away, the maid was
      carefully looking in the blanket for the baby. Having found it and turned
      aside the covering from its face, she came nearer, and holding up the
      little vision, about the size and colour of a roll of red wax taper, said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look at it, sir! It's your own, and worth looking at."
    </p>
    <p>
      Never before had she dared speak to him so!
    </p>
    <p>
      I will not venture to assert that Mr. Dempster turned white, but his
      countenance changed, and he dropped into the chair behind him, feeling
      less of a business man than had been his consciousness for the last twenty
      years. He was hit hard. The absolutely Incredible had hit him. Babies
      might be born in a day, but surely not without previous preparation on the
      part of nature at least, if not on that of the mother; and in this case if
      the mother had prepared herself, certainly she had not prepared him for
      the event. It was as if the treasure of Nature's germens were tumbling all
      together. His head swam. He could not speak a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir," the maid went on, relieved of her trepidation in perceiving
      that her master too was mortal, and that her word had such power over him&mdash;proud
      also of knowing more of his concerns than he did himself, "she was took
      about an hour and a half ago. We've kep' sendin' an' sendin' after the
      doctor, but he ain't never been yet; only cook, she knows a deal an' she
      says she's been very bad, sir. But the young gentleman come at last, bless
      him! and now she's doin' as well as could be expected, sir&mdash;cook
      says."
    </p>
    <p>
      "God bless me!" said the astonished father, and relapsed into the silence
      of bewilderment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eight years married with never a glimmer of offspring&mdash;and now, all
      at once, and without a whisper of warning, the father of a "young
      gentleman!" How could it be other than perplexing&mdash;discomposing,
      indeed!&mdash;yet it was right pleasant too. Only it would have been more
      pleasant if experience could have justified the affair! Nature&mdash;no,
      not Nature&mdash;or, if Nature, then Nature sure in some unnatural mood,
      had stolen a march upon him, had gone contrary to all that had ever been
      revealed of her doings before! and why had she pitched on him&mdash;just
      him, Duncan Dempster, to exercise one of her more grotesque and wayward
      moods upon?&mdash;to play at hide-and-seek with after this fashion? She
      had not treated him with exactly proper respect, he thought, or, rather
      vaguely felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Business is business," he remarked, under his breath, "and this cannot be
      called proper business behaviour. What is there about me to make game of?
      Really, my wife ought&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      What his wife ought or ought not to have done, however, had not yet made
      itself clear to him, and his endeavour to excogitate being in that
      direction broken off, gave way to the pleasure of knowing himself a
      father, or perhaps more truly of having an heir. In the strength of it he
      rose, went to the cellaret, and poured himself out a glass of his
      favourite port, which he sat down to drink in silence and meditation. He
      was rather a picture just then and there, though not a very lovely one,
      seated, with his hat still on his head, in the middle of the room, upon a
      chair half-way between the dining-table and the sideboard, with his glass
      of wine in his hand. He was pondering partly the pleasure, but still
      mainly the peculiarity of his position. A bishop once told me that,
      shortly after he had been raised to the episcopal dignity, a friend's
      horses, whose driver had tumbled off the box drunk, ran away with him, and
      upset the carriage. He crept out of the window over his head, and the
      first thought that came to him as he sat perched on the side of the
      carriage, while it was jumbled along by the maddened horses, was, "What do
      bishops do in such circumstances?" Equally perplexing was the question
      Dempster had to ask himself: how husbands who, after being married eight
      years, suddenly and unexpectedly received the gift of a first-born, were
      in the habit of comporting themselves! He poured himself out another
      glass, and with it came the reflection, both amusing and consoling, that
      his brother, who was confidently expecting his tidy five figures to crown
      the earthly bliss of one or more of his large family some day, would be
      equally but less agreeably surprised. "Serve him right!" he said to
      himself. "What business have they to be looking out for my death?" And for
      a moment the heavens appeared a little more just than he was ordinarily in
      the habit of regarding them. He said to himself he would work harder than
      ever now. There would now be some good in making money! He had never given
      his mind to it yet, he said: now the world should see what he could do
      when he did give his mind to it!
    </p>
    <p>
      Hitherto gathering had been his main pleasure, but with the thought of his
      money would now not seldom be mingled the thought of the little thing in
      the blanket! He began to find himself strangely happy. I use the wrong
      phrase&mdash;for the fact is, he had never yet found himself at all; he
      knew nothing of the person except a self-painted and immensely flattered
      portrait that hung in the innermost chamber of his heart&mdash;I mean the
      innermost chamber he knew anything of: there were many chambers there of
      which he did not even know the doors. Yet a few minutes as he sat there,
      and he was actually cherishing a little pride in the wife who had done so
      much better for him than he had at length come to expect. If not a good
      accountant, she was at least a good wife, and a very fair housekeeper: he
      had no doubt she would prove a good mother. He would gladly have gone to
      her at once, to let her know how much he was pleased with her behaviour.
      As for that little bit of red clay&mdash;"terra cotta," he called it to
      himself, as he looked round with a smile at the blanket, which the
      housemaid had replaced on the rug before the fire&mdash;who could imagine
      him a potentate upon 'Change&mdash;perhaps in time a director of European
      affairs! He was not in the way of joking&mdash;of all things about money;
      the very thought, of business filled him from top to toe with seriousness;
      but he did make that small joke, and accompany it with a grim smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was startled from his musing by the entrance of the doctor, who had in
      the meantime arrived and seen the lady, and now came to look at the baby.
      He congratulated Mr. Dempster on having at length a son and heir, but
      warned him that his wife was far from being beyond danger yet. The whole
      thing was entirely out of the common, he said, and she must be taken the
      greatest possible care of. The words woke a gentle pity in the heart of
      the man, for by nature all men have some tenderness for women in such
      circumstances, but they did not trouble him greatly&mdash;for such dangers
      belonged to their calling, their <i>business</i> in life, and, doubtless,
      if she had attended to that business earlier she would have found it
      easier.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you ever know such a thing before, doctor?" he asked, with the
      importance of one honoured by a personal visit from the Marvellous.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never in my own practice," answered the doctor, whom the cook had
      instructed in the wonders of the case, "but I have read of such a thing."
      And Mr. Dempster swelled like a turkey-cock.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was several days before he was allowed to see the mother. Perhaps had
      she expressed a strong desire to see him, it might have been risked
      sooner, but she had neither expressed nor manifested any. He kissed her,
      spoke a few stupid words in a kind tone, asking her how she did, but
      paying no heed to her answer, and turned aside to look, at the baby.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dempster recovered but slowly, and not very satisfactorily. She did
      not seem to care much about the child. She tried to nurse him, but was not
      very successful. She took him when the nurse brought him, and yielded him
      again with the same indifference, showing neither pleasure to receive nor
      unwillingness to part with him. The nurse did not fail to observe it and
      remark upon it: <i>she</i> had never seen a mother care so little for her
      child! there was little of the mother in <i>her</i> any way! it was no
      wonder she was so long about it. It troubled the father a little that she
      should not care for his child: some slight fermentation had commenced in
      the seemingly dead mass of human affection that had lain so long neglected
      in his being, and it seemed strange to him that, while he was living for
      the child in the City, she should be so indifferent to him at home. For
      already he had begun to keep his vow, already his greater keenness in
      business was remarked in the City. But it boded little good for either
      that the gift of God should stir up in him the worship of Mammon. More
      sons are damned by their fathers' money than by anything else whatever
      outside of themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was the excuse to be made for Mrs. Dempster that she continued far
      from strong&mdash;and her husband made it: he would have made it more
      heartily if he had himself ever in his life known what it was to be ill.
      By degrees she grew stronger, however, until, to persons who had not known
      her before, she would have seemed in tolerable health. For a week or two
      after she was again going about the house, she continued to nurse the
      baby, but after that she became unable to do so, and therewith began to
      neglect him entirely. She never asked to see him, and when the nurse
      brought him would turn her head aside, and tell her to take it away. So
      far from his being a pleasure to her, the very sight of the child brought
      the hot dew upon her forehead. Her husband frowned and wondered, but,
      unaccustomed to open his mind either to her or to any one else, not
      unwisely sought to understand the thing before speaking of it, and in the
      meantime commenced a genuine attempt to make up to the baby for his
      mother's neglect. Almost without a notion how even to take him in his
      arms, he would now send for him the moment he had had his tea, and after a
      fashion, ludicrous in the eyes of the nurse, would dandle and caress him,
      and strut about with him before his wife, glancing up at her every now and
      then, to point the lesson that such was the manner in which a parent ought
      to behave to a child. In his presence she never made any active show of
      her dislike, but her look seemed all the time fixed on something far away,
      as if she had nothing to do with the affair.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III. ANOTHER ASTONISHMENT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      But a second and very different astonishment awaited Mr. Dempster. Again
      one evening, on his return from the City, he saw a strange look on the
      face of the girl who opened the door&mdash;but this time it was a look of
      fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?" he said, in a tone at once alarmed and peremptory.
    </p>
    <p>
      She made no answer, but turned whiter than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is your mistress?" he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nobody knows, sir," she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nobody knows! What would you have me understand by such an answer?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's the bare truth, sir. Nobody knows where she is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "God bless me!" cried the husband. "What does it all mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      And again he sunk down upon a chair&mdash;this time in the hall, and
      stared at the girl as if waiting further enlightenment.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was little enough to be had. Only one point was clear: his wife
      was nowhere to be found. He sent for every one in the house, and
      cross-questioned each to discover the last occasion on which she had been
      seen. It was some time since she had been missed; how long before that she
      had been seen there was no certainty to be had. He ran to the doctor, then
      from one to another of her acquaintance, then to her mother, who lived on
      the opposite side of London. She, like the rest, could tell him nothing.
      In her anxiety she would have gone back with him, but he was surly, and
      would not allow her. It was getting towards morning before he reached
      home, but no relieving news awaited him. What to think was as much a
      perplexity to him as what to do. He was not in the agony in which a man
      would have been who thoroughly loved his wife, but he cared enough about
      her to feel uncomfortable; and the cries of the child, who was suffering
      from some ailment, made him miserable: in his perplexity and dull sense of
      helplessness he wondered whether she might not have given the baby poison
      before she went. Then the thing would make such a talk! and, of all
      things, Duncan Dempster hated being talked about. How busy people's brains
      would be with all his affairs! How many explanations of the mystery would
      be suggested on 'Change! Some would say, "What business had a man like him
      with a fine lady for a wife? one so much younger than himself too!" He
      could remember making the same remark of another, before he was married.
      "Served him right!" they would say. And with that the first movement of
      suspicion awoke in him&mdash;purely and solely from his own mind's
      reflection of the imagined minds of others. While in his mind's ear he
      heard them talking, almost before he knew what they meant the words came
      to him: "There was that Major Strong, you know!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's gone to him!" he cried aloud, and, springing from the bed on which
      he had thrown himself, he paced the chamber in a fury. He had no word for
      it but hers that he was now in India! They had only been waiting till&mdash;By
      heaven, that child was none of his! And therewith rushed into his mind the
      conviction that everything was thus explained. No man ever yet entertained
      an unhappy suspicion, but straightway an army of proofs positive came
      crowding to the service of the lie. It is astounding with what manifest
      probability everything will fall in to prove that a fact which has no
      foundation whatever! There is no end to the perfection with which a man
      may fool himself while taking absolute precautions against being fooled by
      others. Every fact, being a living fact, has endless sides and relations;
      but of all these, the man whose being hangs upon one thought, will see
      only those sides and relations which fall in with that thought. Dempster
      even recalled the words of the maid, "It's mis'ess's," as embodying the
      girl's belief that it was not master's. Where a man, whether by nature
      jealous or not, is in a jealous condition, there is no need of an Iago to
      parade before him the proofs of his wrong. It was because Shakespere would
      neither have Desdemona less than perfect, nor Othello other than the most
      trusting and least suspicious of men, that he had to invent an all but
      incredible villain to effect the needful catastrophe.
    </p>
    <p>
      But why should a man, who has cared so little for his wife, become
      instantly, upon the bare suspicion, so utter a prey to consuming misery?
      There was a character in his suffering which could not be attributed to
      any degree of anger, shame, or dread of ridicule. The truth was, there lay
      in his being a possibility of love to his wife far beyond anything his
      miserably stunted consciousness had an idea of; and the conviction of her
      faithlessness now wrought upon him in the office of Death, to let him know
      what he had lost. It magnified her beauty in his eyes, her gentleness, her
      grace; and he thought with a pang how little he had made of her or it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the next moment wrath at the idea of another man's child being imposed
      upon him as his, with the consequent loss of his precious money, swept
      every other feeling before it. For by law the child was his, whoever might
      be the father of it. During a whole minute he felt on the point of tying a
      stone about its neck, carrying it out, and throwing it into the river Lea.
      Then, with the laugh of a hyena, he set about arranging in his mind the
      proofs of her guilt. First came eight childless years with himself; next
      the concealment of her condition, and the absurd pretence that she had
      known nothing of it; then the trouble of mind into which she had fallen;
      then her strange unnatural aversion to her own child; and now, last of
      all, conclusive of a guilty conscience, her flight from his house. He
      would give himself no trouble to find her; why should he search after his
      own shame! He would neither attempt to conceal nor to explain the fact
      that she had left him&mdash;people might say what they pleased&mdash;try
      him for murder if they liked! As to the child she had so kindly left to
      console him for her absence, he would not drown him, neither would he
      bring him up in his house; he would give him an ordinary education, and
      apprentice him to a trade. For his money, he would leave it to a hospital&mdash;a
      rich one, able to defend his will if disputed. For what was the child? A
      monster&mdash;a creature that had no right to existence!
    </p>
    <p>
      Not one of those who knew him best would have believed him capable of
      being so moved, nor did one of them now know it, for he hid his suffering
      with the success of a man not unaccustomed to make a mask of his face.
      There are not a few men who, except something of the nature of a
      catastrophe befall them, will pass through life without having or
      affording a suspicion of what is in them. Everything hitherto had tended
      to suppress the live elements of Duncan Dempster; but now, like the fire
      of a volcano in a land of ice, the vitality in him had begun to show
      itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sheer weariness drove him, as the morning began to break, to lie down
      again; but he neither undressed nor slept, and rose at his usual hour.
      When he entered the dining-room, where breakfast was laid as usual&mdash;only
      for one instead of two&mdash;he found by his plate, among letters
      addressed to his wife, a packet directed to himself. It had not been
      through the post, and the address was in his wife's hand. He opened it. A
      sheet of paper was wrapped around a roll of unpaid butcher's bills,
      amounting to something like eighty pounds, and a note from the butcher
      craving immediate settlement. On the sheet of paper was written, also in
      his wife's hand, these words: "I am quite unworthy of being your wife any
      longer;" that was all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now here, to a man who had loved her enough to understand her, was a clue
      to the whole&mdash;to Dempster it was the strongest possible confirmation
      of what he had already concluded. To him it appeared as certain as
      anything he called truth, that for years, while keeping a fair face to her
      husband&mdash;a man who had never refused her anything&mdash;he did not
      recall the fact that almost never had she asked or he offered anything&mdash;she
      had been deceiving him, spending money she would not account for,
      pretending to pay everything when she had been ruining his credit with the
      neighbourhood, making him, a far richer man than any but himself knew,
      appear to be living beyond his means, when he was every month investing
      far more than he spent. It was injury upon injury! Then, as a last mark of
      her contempt, she had taken pains that these beggarly butcher's bills
      should reach him from her own hand! He would trouble himself about such a
      woman not a moment longer!
    </p>
    <p>
      He went from breakfast to his omnibus as usual, walked straight to his
      office, and spent the day according to custom. I need hardly say that the
      first thing he did was to write a cheque for the butcher. He made no
      further inquiry after her whatever, nor was any made of him there, for
      scarcely one of the people with whom he did business had been to his
      house, or had even seen his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the suburb where he lived it was different; but he paid no heed to any
      inquiry, beyond saying he knew nothing about her. To her relatives he said
      that if they wanted her they might find her for themselves. She had gone
      to please herself, and he was not going to ruin himself by running about
      the world after her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Night after night he came home to his desolate house; took no comfort from
      his child; made no confession that he stood in need of comfort. But he had
      a dull sensation as if the sun had forsaken the world, and an endless
      night had begun. The simile, of course, is mine&mdash;the sensation only
      was his; <i>he</i> could never have expressed anything that went on in the
      region wherein men suffer.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days made a marked difference in his appearance. He was a hard man;
      but not so hard as people had thought him; and besides, <i>no</i> man can
      rule his own spirit except he has the spirit of right on his side; neither
      is any man proof against the inroads of good. Even Lady Macbeth was
      defeated by the imagination she had braved. Add to this, that no man can,
      even by those who understand him best, be labelled as a box containing
      such and such elements, for the humanity in him is deeper than any
      individuality, and may manifest itself at some crisis in a way altogether
      beside expectation.
    </p>
    <p>
      His feeling was not at first of an elevated kind. After the grinding wrath
      had abated, self-pity came largely to the surface&mdash;not by any means a
      grand emotion, though very dear to boys and girls in their first
      consciousness of self, and in them pardonable enough. On the same ground
      it must be pardoned in a man who, with all his experience of the world,
      was more ignorant of the region of emotion, and more undeveloped morally,
      than multitudes of children: in him it was an indication that the shell
      was beginning to break. He said to himself that he was old beside her, and
      that she had begun to weary of him, and despise him. Gradually upon this,
      however, supervened at intervals a faint shadow of pity for her who could
      not have been happy or she would not have left him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Days and weeks passed, and there was no sign of Mrs. Dempster. The child
      was not sent out to nurse, and throve well enough. His father never took
      the least notice of him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV. WHAT IT MEANT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Some of my readers, perhaps all of them, will have concluded that Mrs.
      Dempster was a little out of her mind. Such, indeed, was the fact, and one
      not greatly to be wondered at, after such a peculiar experience as she had
      had. Some small degree of congestion, and the consequent pressure on some
      portion of the brain, had sent certain faculties to sleep, and, perhaps,
      roused others into morbid activity. That it is impossible to tell where
      sanity ends and insanity begins, is a trite remark indeed; but like many
      things which it is useless to say, it has the more need to be thought of.
      If I yield to an impulse of which I know I shall be ashamed, is it not the
      act of a madman? And may not the act lead to a habit, and at length to a
      despised, perhaps feared and hated, old age, twisting at the ragged ends
      of a miserable life?
    </p>
    <p>
      However certain it is that mental disorder had to do with Mrs. Dempster's
      departure from her home, it is almost as certain she would never have gone
      had it not been for the unpaid bills haunting her consciousness, a
      combination of demon and ghost. The misery had all the time been growing
      upon her, and must have had no small share in the subversion of her
      microcosm. When that was effected, the evil thing that lay at the root of
      it all rose and pounced upon her. Wrong is its own avenger. She had been
      doing wrong, and knowingly for years, and now the plant of evil was
      blossoming towards its fruit. If one say the evil was but a trifle, I take
      her judgment, not his, upon that. She had been lazy towards duty, had
      persistently turned aside from what she knew to be her business, until she
      dared not even look at it. And now that the crisis was at hand, as omened
      by that letter from the butcher, with the sense of her wrong-doing was
      mingled the terror of her husband. What would he think, say, and do? Not
      yet had she, after all these years, any deep insight into his character;
      else perhaps she might have read there that, much as he loved money, the
      pleasure of seeing signal failure follow the neglect of his instructions
      would quite compensate him for the loss. What the bills amounted to, she
      had not an idea. Not until she had made up her mind to leave her home
      could she muster the courage to get them together. Then she even counted
      up the total and set down the sum in her memory&mdash;which sum thereafter
      haunted her like the name of her devil.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the making up of her mind&mdash;she could remember very little of
      that process&mdash;or indeed of the turning of her resolve into action.
      She left the house in the plainest dress her wardrobe could afford her,
      and with just one half-crown in her pocket. Her design was to seek a
      situation, as a refuge from her husband and his wrath. It was a curious
      thing, that, while it gave her no trouble to leave her baby, whom indeed
      she had not that day seen, and to whom for some time she had ceased to be
      necessary, her only notion was to get a place as nurse.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that time, I presume, there were few or no such offices for engaging
      servants as are now common; at all events, the plan Mrs. Dempster took,
      when she had reached a part of London she judged sufficiently distant for
      her purpose, was to go from shop to shop inquiring after a situation. But
      she met with no prospect of success, and at last, greatly in need of rest
      and refreshment, went into a small coffee shop. The woman who kept it was
      taken by her appearance, her manners, and her evident trouble, and,
      happening to have heard of a lady who wanted a nurse, gave her the
      address. She went at once, and applied for the place. The lady was much
      pleased with her, and agreed to take her, provided she received a
      satisfactory character of her. For such a demand Mrs. Dempster was
      unprepared; she had never thought what reference she could give, and, her
      resources for deception easily exhausted, gave, driven to extremity, the
      name and address of her mother. So met the extremes of loss and salvation!
      She returned to the coffee shop, and the lady wrote at once to the address
      of the young woman's late mistress, as she supposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The kindness of her new friend was not exhausted; she gave her a share of
      her own bed that night. Mrs. Dempster had now but two shillings, which she
      offered her, promising to pay her the rest out of the first wages she
      received. But the good woman would take no more than one of them, and that
      in full payment of what she owed her, and Mrs. Dempster left the shop in
      tears, to linger about the neighbourhood until the hour should arrive at
      which the lady had told her to call again. Apparently she must have
      cherished the hope that her mother, divining her extremity, would give her
      the character she could honestly claim. But as she drew near the door
      which she hoped would prove a refuge, her mother was approaching it also,
      and at the turning of a corner they ran into each other's arms. The
      elderly lady had a hackney coach waiting for her in the next street, and
      Mrs. Dempster, too tired to resist, got into it at once at her mother's
      desire. Ere they reached the mother's house, which, as I have said, was a
      long way from Mr. Dempster's, the daughter told everything, and the mother
      had perceived more than the daughter could tell: her eyes had revealed
      that all was not right behind them. She soothed her as none but a mother
      can, easily persuading her she would make everything right, and
      undertaking herself to pay the money owing to the butcher. But it was soon
      evident that for the present there must be no suggestion of her going back
      to her husband; for, imagining from something, that her mother was taking
      her to him, she jumped up and had all but opened the door of the cab when
      her mother succeeded in mastering her. As soon as she was persuaded that
      such had never been the intention, she was quiet. When they reached the
      house she was easily induced to go to bed at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mother lived in a very humble way, with one servant, a trustworthy
      woman. To her she confided the whole story, and with her consulted as to
      what had better be done. Between them they resolved to keep her, for a
      while at least, in retirement and silence. To this conclusion they came on
      the following grounds: First, the daughter's terror and the mother's own
      fear of Mr. Dempster; next, it must be confessed, the resentment of both
      mistress and servant because of his rudeness when he came to inquire after
      her; third, the evident condition of the poor creature's mind; and last,
      the longing of the two women to have her to themselves, that they might
      nurse and cosset her to their hearts' content.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were to have more of this indulgence, however, than, for her sake,
      they would have desired, for before morning she was very ill. She had
      brain fever, in fact, and they had their hands full, especially as they
      desired to take every precaution to prevent the neighbourhood from knowing
      there was any one but themselves in the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a severe attack, but she passed the crisis favourably, and began to
      recover. One morning, after a quieter night than usual, she called her
      mother, and told her she had had a strange dream&mdash;that she had a baby
      somewhere, but could not find him, and was wandering about looking for
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wasn't it a curious dream, mamma?" she said. "I wish it were a true one.
      I knew exactly what my baby was like, and went into house after house full
      of children, sure that I could pick him out of thousands. I was just going
      up to the door of the Foundling Hospital to look for him there when I
      woke."
    </p>
    <p>
      As she ceased, a strange trouble passed like a cloud over her forehead and
      eyes, and her hand, worn almost transparent by the fever followed it over
      forehead and eyes. She seemed trying to recall something forgotten. But
      her mother thought it better to say nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each of the two nights following she had the same dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Three times, mother," she said. "I am not superstitious, as you know, but
      I can't help feeling as if it must mean something. I don't know what to
      make of it else&mdash;except it be that I haven't got over the fever yet.
      And, indeed, I am afraid my head is not quite right, for I can't be sure
      sometimes, such a hold has my dream of me, that I haven't got a baby
      somewhere about the world. Give me your hand, mother, and sing to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Still her mother thought it more prudent to say nothing, and do what she
      could to divert her thoughts; for she judged it must be better to let her
      brain come right, as it were, of itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the middle of the next night she woke her with a cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, mother, mother! I know it all now. I am not out of my mind any more.
      How I came here I cannot tell&mdash;but I know I have a husband and a baby
      at Hackney&mdash;and&mdash;oh, such a horrible roll of butcher's bills!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes, my dear! I know all about it," answered her mother. "But never
      mind; you can pay them all yourself now, for I heard only yesterday that
      your aunt Lucy is dead, and has left you the hundred pounds she promised
      you twenty years ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, bless her!" cried Mrs. Dempster, springing out of bed, much to the
      dismay of her mother, who boded a return of the fever. "I must go home to
      my baby at once. But tell me all about it, mamma. How did I come here? I
      seem to remember being in a carriage with you, and that is the last I
      know."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, upon condition that she got into bed at once, and promised not to
      move until she gave her leave, her mother consented to tell her all she
      knew. She listened in silence, with face flushed and eyes glowing, but
      drank a cooling draught, lay down again, and at daybreak was fast asleep.
      When she awoke she was herself again.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V. WHAT CAME OF IT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Meantime, things were going, as they should, in rather a dull fashion with
      Duncan Dempster. His chariot wheels were gone, and he drove heavily. The
      weather was good; he seldom failed of the box-seat on the omnibus; a ray
      of light, the first he had ever seen there, visited his table, reflected
      from a new window on the opposite side of a court into the heart of his
      dismal back office; and best of all, business was better than usual. Yet
      was Dempster not cheerful. He was not, indeed, a man an acquaintance would
      ever have thought of calling cheerful; but in grays there are gradations;
      and however differently a man's barometer may be set from those of other
      people, it has its ups and downs, its fair weather and foul. But not yet
      had he an idea how much his mental equilibrium had been dependent upon the
      dim consciousness of having that quiet uninterested wife in the
      comfortable house at Hackney. It had been stronger than it seemed, the
      spidery, invisible line connecting that office and that house, along which
      had run twice a day the hard dumpling that dwelt in Mr. Dempster's bosom.
      Vaguely connected with that home after all must have been that endless
      careful gathering of treasure in the city; for now, though he could no
      more stop making money than he could stop breathing, it had not the same
      interest as formerly. Indeed, he had less interest than before in keeping
      his lungs themselves going. But he kept on doing everything as usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not one of the men he met ever said a word to him about his wife. The
      general impression was that she had left him for preferable society, and
      no one wondered at her throwing aside such "a dry old stick," whom even
      the devoted slaves of business contemned as having nothing in him but
      business.
    </p>
    <p>
      A further change was, however, in progress within him. The first sign of
      it was that he began to doubt whether his wife had indeed been false to
      him&mdash;had forsaken him in any other company than that of Death. But
      there was one great difficulty in the way of the conclusion. It was
      impossible for him to imagine suicide as proceeding from any cause but
      insanity, and what could have produced the disorder in one who had no
      cares or anxieties, everything she wanted, and nothing to trouble her, a
      devoted husband, and a happy home? Yet the mere idea made him think more
      pitifully, and so more tenderly of her than before. It had not yet
      occurred to him to consider whether he might not have had something to do
      with her conduct or condition. Blame was a thing he had never made
      acquaintance with&mdash;least of all in the form of self-blame. To himself
      he was simply all right&mdash;the poised centre of things capable of
      righteous judgment on every one else. But it must not be forgotten how
      little he knew about his own affairs at all; his was a very different
      condition from that of one who had closed his eyes and hardened his heart
      to suspicions concerning himself. His eyes had never yet been opened to
      anything but the order of things in the money world&mdash;its laws, its
      penalties, its rewards&mdash;those he did understand. But apparently he
      was worth troubling. A slow dissatisfaction was now preying upon him&mdash;a
      sense of want&mdash;of not having something he once had, a vague
      discomfort, growing restless. This feeling was no doubt the worse that the
      birth of the child had brought such a sudden rush of fresh interest into
      his occupation, which doubt concerning that birth had again so suddenly
      checked; but even if the child should prove after all his own, a
      supposition he was now willing to admit as possibly a true one, he could
      never without his mother feel any enthusiasm about him, even such
      enthusiasm as might be allowed to a man who knew money from moonshine, and
      common sense from hysterics. Yet once and again, about this time, the
      nurse coming into the room after a few minutes' absence, found him bending
      over the sleeping infant, and, as she described him, "looking as if he
      would have cried if he had only known how."
    </p>
    <p>
      One frosty evening in late autumn the forsaken husband came from London&mdash;I
      doubt if he would now have said "home"&mdash;as usual, on the top of the
      omnibus. His was a tough nature physically, as well as morally, and if he
      had found himself inside an omnibus he would have thought he was going to
      die. The sun was down. A green hue rose from the horizon half-way to the
      zenith, but a pale yellow lingered over the vanished sun, like the gold at
      the bottom of a chrysolite. The stars were twinkling small and sharp in
      the azure overhead. A cold wind blew in little gusts, now from this side,
      now from that, as they went steadily along. The horses' hoofs rang loud on
      the hard road. The night got hold of him: it was at this season, and on
      nights like these, that he had haunted the house of Lucy's father, doing
      his best to persuade her to make him, as he said, a happy man. It now
      seemed as if then, and then only, he had been a happy man. Certainly, of
      all his life, it was the time when he came nearest to having a peep out of
      the upper windows of the house of life. He had been a dweller in the lower
      regions, a hewer of wood to the god of the cellar; and after his marriage,
      he had gone straight down again to the temple of the earthy god&mdash;to a
      worship whose god and temple and treasure caves will one day drop suddenly
      from under the votary's feet, and leave him dangling in the air without
      even a pocket about him&mdash;without even his banker's book to show for
      his respectability.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night, I say, recalled the lovely season of his courtship, and again,
      in the mirror of loss, he caught a glimpse of things beyond him. Ah, if
      only that time and its hopes had remained with him! How different things
      would have been now! If Lucy had proved what he thought her!&mdash;remained
      what she seemed&mdash;the gentle, complaisant, yielding lady he imagined
      her, promising him a life of bliss! Alas, she would not even keep account
      of five pounds a week to please him! He never thought whether he, on his
      part, might not have, in some measure, come short of her expectations in a
      husband; whether she, the more lovely in inward design and outward
      fashion, might not have indulged yet more exquisite dreams of bliss which,
      by devotion to his ideal of life, he had done his part in disappointing.
      He only thought what a foolishness it all was; that thus it would go on to
      the end of the book; that youth after youth would have his turn of such a
      wooing, and such a disappointment. Sunsets, indeed! The suns of man's
      happiness never did anything but set! Out of money even&mdash;and who
      could say there was any poetry in that?&mdash;there was not half the
      satisfaction to be got that one expected. It was all a mess of
      expectations and disappointments mashed up together&mdash;nothing more.
      That was the world&mdash;on a fair judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such were his reflections till the driver pulled up for him to get down at
      his own gate. As he got down the said driver glanced up curiously at the
      row of windows on the first floor, and as soon as Mr. Dempster's back was
      turned, pointed to them with the butt-end of his whip, and nodded queerly
      to the gentleman who sat on his other side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's more'n I've seen this six weeks," he said. "There's something
      more'n common up this evenin', sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was light in the drawing-room&mdash;that was all the wonder; but at
      those windows Mr. Dempster himself looked so fixedly that he had nearly
      stumbled up his own door-steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      He carried a latch-key now, for he did not care to stand at the door till
      the boy answered the bell; people's eyes, as they passed, seemed to burn
      holes in the back of his coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened the street door quietly, and went straight up the stair to the
      drawing-room. Perhaps he thought to detect some liberty taken by his
      servants. He was a little earlier than usual. He opened that door, took
      two steps into the room, and stood arrested, motionless. With his shabby
      hat on his head, his shabby greatcoat on his back&mdash;for he grudged
      every penny spent on his clothes&mdash;his arms hanging down by his sides,
      and his knees bent, ready to tremble, he looked not a little out of
      keeping in the soft-lighted, dainty, delicate-hued drawing-room. Could he
      believe his eyes? The light of a large lamp was centred upon a gracious
      figure in white&mdash;his wife, just as he used to see her before he
      married her! That was the way her hair would break loose as she ran down
      the stair to meet him!&mdash;only then there was no baby in her lap for it
      to full over like a torrent of unlighted water over a white stone! It was
      a lovely sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had stood but a moment when she looked up and saw him. She started, but
      gave no cry louder than a little moan. Instantly she rose. Turning, she
      laid the baby on the sofa, and flitted to him like a wraith. Arrived where
      he stood yet motionless, she fell upon her knees and clasped his. He was
      far too bewildered now to ask himself what husbands did in such
      circumstances, and stood like a block.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Husband! husband!" she cried, "forgive me." With one hand she hid her
      face, although it was bent to the ground, and with the other held up to
      him a bit of paper. He took it from the thin white fingers; it might
      explain something&mdash;help him out of this bewilderment, half nightmare,
      half heavenly vision. He opened it. Nothing but a hundred-pound note! The
      familiar sight of bank paper, however, seemed to restore his speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What does this mean, Lucy? Upon my word! Permit me to say&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was growing angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is to pay the butcher," she said, with a faltering voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Damn the butcher!" he cried. "I hope you've got something else to say to
      me! Where have you been all this time?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "At my mother's. I've had a brain fever, and been out of my mind. It was
      all about the butcher's bill."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dempster stared. Perhaps he could not understand how a woman who would not
      keep accounts should be to such a degree troubled at the result of her
      neglect.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look at me, if you don't believe me," she cried, and as she spoke she
      rose and lifted her face to his.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gazed at it for a moment&mdash;pale, thin, and worn; and out of it
      shone the beautiful eyes, larger than before, but shimmering uncertain
      like the stars of a humid night, although they looked straight into his.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something queer was suddenly the matter with his throat&mdash;something he
      had never felt before&mdash;a constriction such as, had he been
      superstitious, he might have taken for the prologue to a rope. Then the
      thought came&mdash;what a brute he must be that his wife should have been
      afraid to tell him her trouble! Thereupon he tried to speak, but his
      throat was irresponsive to his will. Eve's apple kept sliding up and down
      in it, and would not let the words out. He had never been so served by
      members of his own body in his life before! It was positive rebellion, and
      would get him into trouble with his wife. There it was! Didn't he say so?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can't you forgive me, Mr. Dempster?" she said, and the voice was so sweet
      and so sad! "It is my own money. Aunt Lucy is dead, and left it me. I
      think it will be enough to pay all my debts; and I promise you&mdash;I do
      promise you that I will set down every halfpenny after this. Do try me
      once again&mdash;for baby's sake."
    </p>
    <p>
      This last was a sudden thought. She turned and ran to the sofa. Dempster
      stood where he was, fighting the strange uncomfortable feeling in his
      throat. It would not yield a jot. Was he going to die suddenly of choking?
      Was it a judgment upon him? Diphtheria, perhaps! It was much about in the
      City!
    </p>
    <p>
      She was back, and holding up to him their sleeping child.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor fellow was not half the brute he looked&mdash;only he could <i>not</i>
      tell what to do with that confounded lump in his throat! He dared not try
      to speak, for it only choked him the more. He put his arms round them
      both, and pressed them to his bosom. Then, the lump in his throat melted
      and ran out at his eyes, and all doubt vanished like a mist before the
      sun. But he never knew that he had wept. His wife did, and that was
      enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, for the first time in his life, he lost the eight
      o'clock omnibus.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following Monday morning she brought her week's account to him. He
      turned from it testily, but she insisted on his going over it. There was
      not the mistake of a halfpenny. He went to town with a smile in his heart,
      and that night brought her home a cheque for ten pounds instead of five.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, in the middle of the same week, he came upon her sitting over the
      little blue-and-red-ruled book with a troubled countenance. She took no
      notice of his entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do leave those accounts," he said, "and attend to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head impatiently, and made him no other answer. One moment
      more, however, and she started up, threw her arms about his neck, and
      cried triumphantly,
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's buttons!&mdash;fourpence-halfpenny I paid for buttons!"

    <h2>
      PORT IN A STORM
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Papa," said my sister Effie, one evening as we all sat about the
      drawing-room fire. One after another, as nothing followed, we turned our
      eyes upon her. There she sat, still silent, embroidering the corner of a
      cambric hand-kerchief, apparently unaware that she had spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a very cold night in the beginning of winter. My father had come
      home early, and we had dined early that we might have a long evening
      together, for it was my father's and mother's wedding-day, and we always
      kept it as the homeliest of holidays. My father was seated in an
      easy-chair by the chimney corner, with a jug of Burgundy near him, and my
      mother sat by his side, now and then taking a sip out of his glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Effie was now nearly nineteen; the rest of us were younger. What she was
      thinking about we did not know then, though we could all guess now.
      Suddenly she looked up, and seeing all eyes fixed upon her, became either
      aware or suspicious, and blushed rosy red.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You spoke to me, Effie. What was it, my dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "O yes, papa. I wanted to ask you whether you wouldn't tell us, to-night,
      the story about how you&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, my love?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "&mdash;About how you&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am listening, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean, about mamma and you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes. About how I got your mamma for a mother to you. Yes. I paid a
      dozen of port for her."
    </p>
    <p>
      We all and each exclaimed <i>Papa</i>! and my mother laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell us all about it," was the general cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I will," answered my father. "I must begin at the beginning,
      though."
    </p>
    <p>
      And, filling his glass with Burgundy, he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As far back as I can remember, I lived with my father in an old
      manor-house in the country. It did not belong to my father, but to an
      elder brother of his, who at that time was captain of a seventy-four. He
      loved the sea more than his life; and, as yet apparently, had loved his
      ship better than any woman. At least he was not married.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My mother had been dead for some years, and my father was now in very
      delicate health. He had never been strong, and since my mother's death, I
      believe, though I was too young to notice it, he had pined away. I am not
      going to tell you anything about him just now, because it does not belong
      to my story. When I was about five years old, as nearly as I can judge,
      the doctors advised him to leave England. The house was put into the hands
      of an agent to let&mdash;at least, so I suppose; and he took me with him
      to Madeira, where he died. I was brought home by his servant, and by my
      uncle's directions, sent to a boarding-school; from there to Eton, and
      from there to Oxford.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Before I had finished my studies, my uncle had been an admiral for some
      time. The year before I left Oxford, he married Lady Georgiana Thornbury,
      a widow lady, with one daughter. Thereupon he bade farewell to the sea,
      though I dare say he did not like the parting, and retired with his bride
      to the house where he was born&mdash;the same house I told you I was born
      in, which had been in the family for many generations, and which your
      cousin now lives in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was late in the autumn when they arrived at Culverwood. They were no
      sooner settled than my uncle wrote to me, inviting me to spend
      Christmas-tide with them at the old place. And here you may see that my
      story has arrived at its beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was with strange feelings that I entered the house. It looked so
      old-fashioned, and stately, and grand, to eyes which had been accustomed
      to all the modern commonplaces! Yet the shadowy recollections which hung
      about it gave an air of homeliness to the place, which, along with the
      grandeur, occasioned a sense of rare delight. For what can be better than
      to feel that you are in stately company, and at the same time perfectly at
      home in it? I am grateful to this day for the lesson I had from the sense
      of which I have spoken&mdash;that of mingled awe and tenderness in the
      aspect of the old hall as I entered it for the first time after fifteen
      years, having left it a mere child.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was cordially received by my old uncle and my new aunt. But the moment
      Kate Thornbury entered I lost my heart, and have never found it again to
      this day. I get on wonderfully well without it, though, for I have got the
      loan of a far better one till I find my own, which, therefore, I hope I
      never shall."
    </p>
    <p>
      My father glanced at my mother as he said this, and she returned his look
      in a way which I can now interpret as a quiet satisfied confidence. But
      the tears came in Effie's eyes. She had trouble before long, poor girl!
      But it is not her story I have to tell.&mdash;My father went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your mother was prettier then than she is now, but not so beautiful;
      beautiful enough, though, to make me think there never had been or could
      again be anything so beautiful. She met me kindly, and I met her
      awkwardly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You made me feel that I had no business there," said my mother, speaking
      for the first time in the course of the story.
    </p>
    <p>
      "See there, girls," said my father. "You are always so confident in first
      impressions, and instinctive judgment! I was awkward because, as I said, I
      fell in love with your mother the moment I saw her; and she thought I
      regarded her as an intruder into the old family precincts.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will not follow the story of the days. I was very happy, except when I
      felt too keenly how unworthy I was of Kate Thornbury; not that she meant
      to make me feel it, for she was never other than kind; but she was such
      that I could not help feeling it. I gathered courage, however, and before
      three days were over, I began to tell her all my slowly reviving memories
      of the place, with my childish adventures associated with this and that
      room or outhouse or spot in the grounds; for the longer I was in the place
      the more my old associations with it revived, till I was quite astonished
      to find how much of my history in connection with Culverwood had been
      thoroughly imprinted on my memory. She never showed, at least, that she
      was weary of my stories; which, however interesting to me, must have been
      tiresome to any one who did not sympathize with what I felt towards my old
      nest. From room to room we rambled, talking or silent; and nothing could
      have given me a better chance, I believe, with a heart like your mother's.
      I think it was not long before she began to like me, at least, and liking
      had every opportunity of growing into something stronger, if only she too
      did not come to the conclusion that I was unworthy of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My uncle received me like the jolly old tar that he was&mdash;welcomed me
      to the old ship&mdash;hoped we should make many a voyage together&mdash;and
      that I would take the run of the craft&mdash;all but in one thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'You see, my boy,' he said, 'I married above my station, and I don't want
      my wife's friends to say that I laid alongside of her to get hold of her
      daughter's fortune. No, no, my boy; your old uncle has too much salt water
      in him to do a dog's trick like that. So you take care of yourself&mdash;that's
      all. She might turn the head of a wiser man than ever came out of our
      family.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did not tell my uncle that his advice was already too late; for that,
      though it was not an hour since I had first seen her, my head was so far
      turned already, that the only way to get it right again, was to go on
      turning it in the same direction; though, no doubt, there was a danger of
      overhauling the screw. The old gentleman never referred to the matter
      again, nor took any notice of our increasing intimacy; so that I sometimes
      doubt even now if he could have been in earnest in the very simple warning
      he gave me. Fortunately, Lady Georgiana liked me&mdash;at least I thought
      she did, and that gave me courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's all nonsense, my dear," said my mother. "Mamma was nearly as fond
      of you as I was; but you never wanted courage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I knew better than to show my cowardice, I dare say," returned my father.
      "But," he continued, "things grew worse and worse, till I was certain I
      should kill myself, or go straight out of my mind, if your mother would
      not have me. So it went on for a few days, and Christmas was at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The admiral had invited several old friends to come and spend the
      Christmas week with him. Now you must remember that, although you look on
      me as an old-fashioned fogie&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, papa!" we all interrupted; but he went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet my old uncle was an older-fashioned fogie, and his friends were much
      the same as himself. Now, I am fond of a glass of port, though I dare not
      take it, and must content myself with Burgundy. Uncle Bob would have
      called Burgundy pig-wash. He could not do without his port, though he was
      a moderate enough man, as customs were. Fancy, then, his dismay when, on
      questioning his butler, an old coxen of his own, and after going down to
      inspect in person, he found that there was scarcely more than a dozen of
      port in the wine-cellar. He turned white with dismay, and, till he had
      brought the blood back to his countenance by swearing, he was something
      awful to behold in the dim light of the tallow candle old Jacob held in
      his tattooed fist. I will not repeat the words he used; fortunately, they
      are out of fashion amongst gentlemen, although ladies, I understand, are
      beginning to revive the custom, now old, and always ugly. Jacob reminded
      his honour that he would not have more put down till he had got a proper
      cellar built, for the one there was, he had said, was not fit to put
      anything but dead men in. Thereupon, after abusing Jacob for not reminding
      him of the necessities of the coming season, he turned to me, and began,
      certainly not to swear at his own father, but to expostulate sideways with
      the absent shade for not having provided a decent cellar before his
      departure from this world of dinners and wine, hinting that it was
      somewhat selfish, and very inconsiderate of the welfare of those who were
      to come after him. Having a little exhausted his indignation, he came up,
      and wrote the most peremptory order to his wine-merchant, in Liverpool, to
      let him have thirty dozen of port before Christmas Day, even if he had to
      send it by post-chaise. I took the letter to the post myself, for the old
      man would trust nobody but me, and indeed would have preferred taking it
      himself; but in winter he was always lame from the effects of a bruise he
      had received from a falling spar in the battle of Aboukir.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That night I remember well. I lay in bed wondering whether I might
      venture to say a word, or even to give a hint to your mother that there
      was a word that pined to be said if it might. All at once I heard a whine
      of the wind in the old chimney. How well I knew that whine! For my kind
      aunt had taken the trouble to find out from me what room I had occupied as
      a boy, and, by the third night I spent there, she had got it ready for me.
      I jumped out of bed, and found that the snow was falling fast and thick. I
      jumped into bed again, and began wondering what my uncle would do if the
      port did not arrive. And then I thought that, if the snow went on falling
      as it did, and if the wind rose any higher, it might turn out that the
      roads through the hilly part of Yorkshire in which Culverwood lay, might
      very well be blocked up.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    "The north wind doth blow,
    And we shall have snow,
And what will my uncle do then, poor thing?
    He'll run for his port,
    But he will run short,
And have too much water to drink, poor thing!
</pre>
    <p>
      "With the influences of the chamber of my childhood crowding upon me, I
      kept repenting the travestied rhyme to myself, till I fell asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, boys and girls, if I were writing a novel, I should like to make
      you, somehow or other, put together the facts&mdash;that I was in the room
      I have mentioned; that I had been in the cellar with my uncle for the
      first time that evening; that I had seen my uncle's distress, and heard
      his reflections upon his father. I may add that I was not myself, even
      then, so indifferent to the merits of a good glass of port as to be unable
      to enter into my uncle's dismay, and that of his guests at last, if they
      should find that the snow-storm had actually closed up the sweet
      approaches of the expected port. If I was personally indifferent to the
      matter, I fear it is to be attributed to your mother, and not to myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense!" interposed my mother once more. "I never knew such a man for
      making little of himself and much of other people. You never drank a glass
      too much port in your life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's why I'm so fond of it, my dear," returned my father. "I declare
      you make me quite discontented with my pig-wash here.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That night I had a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The next day the visitors began to arrive. Before the evening after, they
      had all come. There were five of them&mdash;three tars and two land-crabs,
      as they called each other when they got jolly, which, by-the-way, they
      would not have done long without me.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My uncle's anxiety visibly increased. Each guest, as he came down to
      breakfast, received each morning a more constrained greeting.&mdash;I beg
      your pardon, ladies; I forgot to mention that my aunt had lady-visitors,
      of course. But the fact is, it is only the port-drinking visitors in whom
      my story is interested, always excepted your mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "These ladies my admiral uncle greeted with something even approaching to
      servility. I understood him well enough. He instinctively sought to make a
      party to protect him when the awful secret of his cellar should be found
      out. But for two preliminary days or so, his resources would serve; for he
      had plenty of excellent claret and Madeira&mdash;stuff I don't know much
      about&mdash;and both Jacob and himself condescended to manoeuvre a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The wine did not arrive. But the morning of Christmas Eve did. I was
      sitting in my room, trying to write a song for Kate&mdash;that's your
      mother, my dears&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know, papa," said Effie, as if she were very knowing to know that.
    </p>
    <p>
      "&mdash;when my uncle came into the room, looking like Sintram with Death
      and the Other One after him&mdash;that's the nonsense you read to me the
      other day, isn't it; Effie?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not nonsense, dear papa," remonstrated Effie; and I loved her for saying
      it, for surely <i>that</i> is not nonsense.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't mean it," said my father; and turning to my mother, added: "It
      must be your fault, my dear, that my children are so serious that they
      always take a joke for earnest. However, it was no joke with my uncle. If
      he didn't look like Sintram he looked like t'other one.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'The roads are frozen&mdash;I mean snowed up,' he said. 'There's just one
      bottle of port left, and what Captain Calker will say&mdash;I dare say I
      know, but I'd rather not. Damn this weather!&mdash;God forgive me!&mdash;that's
      not right&mdash;but it is trying&mdash;ain't it, my boy?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'What will you give me for a dozen of port, uncle?' was all my answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Give you? I'll give you Culverwood, you rogue.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Done,' I cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'That is,' stammered my uncle, 'that is,' and he reddened like the funnel
      of one of his hated steamers, 'that is, you know, always provided, you
      know. It wouldn't be fair to Lady Georgiana, now, would it? I put it to
      yourself&mdash;if she took the trouble, you know. You understand me, my
      boy?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'That's of course, uncle,' I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Ah! I see you're a gentleman like your father, not to trip a man when he
      stumbles,' said my uncle. For such was the dear old man's sense of honour,
      that he was actually uncomfortable about the hasty promise he had made
      without first specifying the exception. The exception, you know, has
      Culverwood at the present hour, and right welcome he is.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Of course, uncle,' I said&mdash;'between gentlemen, you know. Still, I
      want my joke out, too. What will you give me for a dozen of port to tide
      you over Christmas Day?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Give you, my boy? I'll give you&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      "But here he checked himself, as one that had been burned already.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Bah!' he said, turning his back, and going towards the door; 'what's the
      use of joking about serious affairs like this?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so he left the room. And I let him go. For I had heard that the road
      from Liverpool was impassable, the wind and snow having continued every
      day since that night of which I told you. Meantime, I had never been able
      to summon the courage to say one word to your mother&mdash;I beg her
      pardon, I mean Miss Thornbury.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Christmas Day arrived. My uncle was awful to behold. His friends were
      evidently anxious about him. They thought he was ill. There was such a
      hesitation about him, like a shark with a bait, and such a flurry, like a
      whale in his last agonies. He had a horrible secret which he dared not
      tell, and which yet <i>would</i> come out of its grave at the appointed
      hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Down in the kitchen the roast beef and turkey were meeting their deserts.
      Up in the store-room&mdash;for Lady Georgiana was not above housekeeping,
      any more than her daughter&mdash;the ladies of the house were doing their
      part; and I was oscillating between my uncle and his niece, making myself
      amazingly useful now to one and now to the other. The turkey and the beef
      were on the table, nay, they had been well eaten, before I felt that my
      moment was come. Outside, the wind was howling, and driving the snow with
      soft pats against the window-panes. Eager-eyed I watched General
      Fortescue, who despised sherry or Madeira even during dinner, and would no
      more touch champagne than he would <i>eau sucre</i>, but drank port after
      fish or with cheese indiscriminately&mdash;with eager eyes I watched how
      the last bottle dwindled out its fading life in the clear decanter. Glass
      after glass was supplied to General Fortescue by the fearless cockswain,
      who, if he might have had his choice, would rather have boarded a
      Frenchman than waited for what was to follow. My uncle scarcely ate at
      all, and the only thing that stopped his face from growing longer with the
      removal of every dish was that nothing but death could have made it longer
      than it was already. It was my interest to let matters go as far as they
      might up to a certain point, beyond which it was not my interest to let
      them go, if I could help it. At the same time I was curious to know how my
      uncle would announce&mdash;confess the terrible fact that in his house, on
      Christmas Day, having invited his oldest friends to share with him the
      festivities of the season, there was not one bottle more of port to be
      had.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I waited till the last moment&mdash;till I fancied the admiral was
      opening his mouth; like a fish in despair, to make his confession. He had
      not even dared to make a confidante of his wife in such an awful dilemma.
      Then I pretended to have dropped my table-napkin behind my chair, and
      rising to seek it, stole round behind my uncle, and whispered in his ear:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'What will you give me for a dozen of port now, uncle?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Bah!' he said, 'I'm at the gratings; don't torture me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I'm in earnest, uncle.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "He looked round at me with a sudden flash of bewildered hope in his eye.
      In the last agony he was capable of believing in a miracle. But he made me
      no reply. He only stared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Will you give me Kate? I want Kate,' I whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I will, my boy. That is, if she'll have you. That is, I mean to say, if
      you produce the true tawny.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Of course, uncle; honour bright&mdash;as port in a storm,' I answered,
      trembling in my shoes and everything else I had on, for I was not more
      than three parts confident in the result.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The gentlemen beside Kate happening at the moment to be occupied, each
      with the lady on his other side, I went behind her, and whispered to her
      as I had whispered to my uncle, though not exactly in the same terms.
      Perhaps I had got a little courage from the champagne I had drunk; perhaps
      the presence of the company gave me a kind of mesmeric strength; perhaps
      the excitement of the whole venture kept me up; perhaps Kate herself gave
      me courage, like a goddess of old, in some way I did not understand. At
      all events I said to her:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Kate,'&mdash;we had got so far even then&mdash;'my uncle hasn't another
      bottle of port in his cellar. Consider what a state General Fortescue will
      be in soon. He'll be tipsy for want of it. Will you come and help me to
      find a bottle or two?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "She rose at once, with a white-rose blush&mdash;so delicate I don't
      believe any one saw it but myself. But the shadow of a stray ringlet could
      not fall on her cheek without my seeing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When we got into the hall, the wind was roaring loud, and the few lights
      were flickering and waving gustily with alternate light and shade across
      the old portraits which I had known so well as a child&mdash;for I used to
      think what each would say first, if he or she came down out of the frame
      and spoke to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I stopped, and taking Kate's hand, I said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I daren't let you come farther, Kate, before I tell you another thing:
      my uncle has promised, if I find him a dozen of port&mdash;you must have
      seen what a state the poor man is in&mdash;to let me say something to you&mdash;I
      suppose he meant your mamma, but I prefer saying it to you, if you will
      let me. Will you come and help me to find the port?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "She said nothing, but took up a candle that was on a table in the hall,
      and stood waiting. I ventured to look at her. Her face was now celestial
      rosy red, and I could not doubt that she had understood me. She looked so
      beautiful that I stood staring at her without moving. What the servants
      could have been about that not one of them crossed the hall, I can't
      think.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At last Kate laughed and said&mdash;'Well?' I started, and I dare say
      took my turn at blushing. At least I did not know what to say. I had
      forgotten all about the guests inside. 'Where's the port?' said Kate. I
      caught hold of her hand again and kissed it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You needn't be quite so minute in your account, my dear," said my mother,
      smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will be more careful in future, my love," returned my father.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'What do you want me to do?' said Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Only to hold the candle for me,' I answered, restored to my seven senses
      at last; and, taking it from her, I led the way, and she followed, till we
      had passed through the kitchen and reached the cellar-stairs. These were
      steep and awkward, and she let me help her down."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, Edward!" said my mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes, my love, I understand," returned my father.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Up to this time your mother had asked no questions; but when we stood in
      a vast, low cellar, which we had made several turns to reach, and I gave
      her the candle, and took up a great crowbar which lay on the floor, she
      said at last&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Edward, are you going to bury me alive? or what <i>are</i> you going to
      do?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I'm going to dig you out,' I said, for I was nearly beside myself with
      joy, as I struck the crowbar like a battering-ram into the wall. You can
      fancy, John, that I didn't work the worse that Kate was holding the candle
      for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very soon, though with great effort, I had dislodged a brick, and the
      next blow I gave into the hole sent back a dull echo. I was right!
    </p>
    <p>
      "I worked now like a madman, and, in a very few minutes more, I had
      dislodged the whole of the brick-thick wall which filled up an archway of
      stone and curtained an ancient door in the lock of which the key now
      showed itself. It had been well greased, and I turned it without much
      difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I took the candle from Kate, and led her into a spacious region of
      sawdust, cobweb, and wine-fungus.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'There, Kate!' I cried, in delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'But,' said Kate, 'will the wine be good?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'General Fortescue will answer you that,' I returned, exultantly. 'Now
      come, and hold the light again while I find the port-bin.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "I soon found not one, but several well-filled port-bins. Which to choose
      I could not tell. I must chance that. Kate carried a bottle and the
      candle, and I carried two bottles very carefully. We put them down in the
      kitchen with orders they should not be touched. We had soon carried the
      dozen to the hall-table by the dining-room door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When at length, with Jacob chuckling and rubbing his hands behind us, we
      entered the dining-room, Kate and I, for Kate would not part with her
      share in the joyful business, loaded with a level bottle in each hand,
      which we carefully erected on the sideboard, I presume, from the stare of
      the company, that we presented a rather remarkable appearance&mdash;Kate
      in her white muslin, and I in my best clothes, covered with brick-dust,
      and cobwebs, and lime. But we could not be half so amusing to them as they
      were to us. There they sat with the dessert before them but no
      wine-decanters forthcoming. How long they had sat thus, I have no idea. If
      you think your mamma has, you may ask her. Captain Calker and General
      Fortescue looked positively white about the gills. My uncle, clinging to
      the last hope, despairingly, had sat still and said nothing, and the
      guests could not understand the awful delay. Even Lady Georgiana had begun
      to fear a mutiny in the kitchen, or something equally awful. But to see
      the flash that passed across my uncle's face, when he saw us appear with
      <i>ported arms</i>! He immediately began to pretend that nothing had been
      the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'What the deuce has kept you, Ned, my boy?' he said. 'Fair Hebe,' he went
      on, 'I beg your pardon. Jacob, you can go on decanting. It was very
      careless of you to forget it. Meantime, Hebe, bring that bottle to General
      Jupiter, there. He's got a corkscrew in the tail of his robe, or I'm
      mistaken.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Out came General Fortescue's corkscrew. I was trembling once more with
      anxiety. The cork gave the genuine plop; the bottle was lowered; glug,
      glug, glug, came from its beneficent throat, and out flowed something
      tawny as a lion's mane. The general lifted it lazily to his lips, saluting
      his nose on the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Fifteen! by Gyeove!' he cried. 'Well, Admiral, this <i>was</i> worth
      waiting for! Take care how you decant that, Jacob&mdash;on peril of your
      life.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "My uncle was triumphant. He winked hard at me not to tell. Kate and I
      retired, she to change her dress, I to get mine well brushed, and my hands
      washed. By the time I returned to the dining-room, no one had any
      questions to ask. For Kate, the ladies had gone to the drawing-room before
      she was ready, and I believe she had some difficulty in keeping my uncle's
      counsel. But she did.&mdash;Need I say that was the happiest Christmas I
      ever spent?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how did you find the cellar, papa?" asked Effie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where are your brains, Effie? Don't you remember I told you that I had a
      dream?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. But you don't mean to say the existence of that wine-cellar was
      revealed to you in a dream?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I do, indeed. I had seen the wine-cellar built up just before we left
      for Madeira. It was my father's plan for securing the wine when the house
      was let. And very well it turned out for the wine, and me too. I had
      forgotten all about it. Everything had conspired to bring it to my memory,
      but had just failed of success. I had fallen asleep under all the
      influences I told you of&mdash;influences from the region of my childhood.
      They operated still when I was asleep, and, all other distracting
      influences being removed, at length roused in my sleeping brain the memory
      of what I had seen. In the morning I remembered not my dream only, but the
      event of which my dream was a reproduction. Still, I was under
      considerable doubt about the place, and in this I followed the dream only,
      as near as I could judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The admiral kept his word, and interposed no difficulties between Kate
      and me. Not that, to tell the truth, I was ever very anxious about that
      rock ahead; but it was very possible that his fastidious honour or pride
      might have occasioned a considerable interference with our happiness for a
      time. As it turned out, he could not leave me Culverwood, and I regretted
      the fact as little as he did himself. His gratitude to me was, however,
      excessive, assuming occasionally ludicrous outbursts of thankfulness. I do
      not believe he could have been more grateful if I had saved his ship and
      its whole crew. For his hospitality was at stake. Kind old man!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Here ended my father's story, with a light sigh, a gaze into the bright
      coals, a kiss of my mother's hand which he held in his, and another glass
      of Burgundy.

      <i>Ger.</i> I'm glad you like it. I do myself, though it falls short of my
      intent sadly enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>War.</i> But I don't for the life of me see what <i>this</i> has to do
      with <i>that</i>. You said something about a mould.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ger.</i> I will tell you what I meant. Every individual aspect of
      nature looks to me as if about to give birth to a human form, embodying
      that of which itself only dreams. In this way landscape-painting is, in my
      eyes, the mother of sculpture. That Apollo is of the summer dawn; that
      Aphrodite of the moonlit sea; this picture represents the mother of my
      Psyche.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>War.</i> Under the sheet there?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ger.</i> Yes. You shall see her some day; but to show your work too
      soon, is to uncork your champagne before dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>War.</i> Well, you've spoiled my picture. I shall go home and scrape my
      canvas to the bone.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ger.</i> On second thoughts, I will show you my Psyche. (<i>Uncovers

    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Wat</i>. Ah, Warren! here you are before me! Mr. Gervaise, I hope I see
      you well.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>War.</i> Mr. Waterfield&mdash;an old friend of yours, Gervaise, I
      believe.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ger.</i> I cannot appropriate the honour.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Wat</i>. I was twice in your studio at Rome, but it's six months ago,
      Mr. Gervaise. Ha! (<i>using his eye-glass</i>) What a charming figure! A
      Psyche! Wings suggested by&mdash;Very skilful! Contour lovely! Altogether
      antique in pose and expression!&mdash;Is she a commission?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ger.</i> No.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Wat</i>. Then I beg you will consider her one.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ger.</i> Excuse me; I never work on commission&mdash;at least never in
      this kind. A bust or two I have done.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Wat</i>. By Jove!&mdash;I <i>should</i> like to see your model!&mdash;This
      is perfect. Are you going to carve her?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ger.</i> Possibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Wat</i>. Uncommissioned?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ger.</i> If at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Wat</i>. Well, I can't call it running any risk. What lines!&mdash;You
      will let me drop in some day when you've got your model here?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ger.</i> Impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Wat</i>. You don't mean&mdash;?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ger.</i> I had no model.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Wat</i>. No model? Ha! ha!&mdash;You must excuse me! (GER. <i>takes up
      the wet sheet</i>.) I understand. Reasons. A little mystery enhances&mdash;eh?&mdash;is
      convenient too&mdash;balks intrusion&mdash;throws the drapery over the
      mignonette. I understand. (GER. <i>covers the clay</i>.) Oh! pray don't
      carry out my figure. That <i>is</i> a damper now!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ger.</i> I am not fond of acting the showman. You must excuse me: I am
      busy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Wat</i>. Ah well!&mdash;some other time&mdash;when you've got on with
      her a bit. Good morning. Ta, ta, Warren.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ger.</i> Good morning. This way, if you please. (<i>Shows him out by
      the door to the street</i>.) How did the fellow find his way here?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>War.</i> I am the culprit, I'm sorry to say. He asked me for your
      address, and I gave it him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ger.</i> How long have you known him?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>War.</i> A month or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ger.</i> Don't bring him here again.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>War.</i> Don't say I <i>brought</i> him. I didn't do that. But I'm
      afraid you've not seen the last of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ger.</i> Oh yes, I have! Old Martha would let in anybody, but I've got

      <i>Ger.</i> Possibly. I had a good many models before I left. But it's of
      no consequence; I don't want any at present.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Col. G.</i> He seemed in a great way, sir&mdash;and swore. I couldn't
      make him out.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ger.</i> Ah! hm!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Col. G.</i> He says he saw her come out of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ger. Has</i> there been any girl here? Have you seen any about?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Col. G.</i> No, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ger.</i> My aunt had a dressmaker to meet her here the other evening. I
      have had no model since I came back.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Col. G.</i> The man was in a sad taking about her, sir. I didn't know
      what to make of it. There seemed some truth&mdash;something suspicious.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ger.</i> Perhaps my aunt can throw some light upon it. (COL. G. <i>lingers</i>.)
      That will do. (<i>Exit</i> COL. G.) How oddly the man behaves! A
      sun-stroke in India, perhaps. Or he may have had a knock on the head. I
      must keep my eye on him. (<i>Stops working, steps backward, and gazes at
      the Psyche</i>.) She is growing very like some one! Who can it be? She
      knows she is puzzling me, the beauty! See how she is keeping back a smile!
      She knows if she lets one smile out, her whole face will follow it through
      the clay. How strange the half-lights of memory are! You know and you
      don't know&mdash;both at once. Like a bat in the twilight you are sure of
      it, and the same moment it is nowhere. Who <i>is</i> my Psyche like?&mdash;The
      forehead above the eyebrow, and round by the temple? The half-playful,
      half-sorrowful curve of the lip? The hope in the lifted eyelid? There is
      more there than ever I put there. Some power has been shaping my ends. By
      heaven, I have it!&mdash;No&mdash;yes&mdash;it is&mdash;it is Constance&mdash;momently
      dawning out of the clay! What <i>does</i> this mean? <i>She</i> never gave
      me a sitting&mdash;at least, she has not done so for the last ten years&mdash;yet
      here she is&mdash;she, and no other! I never thought she was beautiful.
      When she came with my aunt the other day though, I did fancy I saw a new
      soul dawning through the lovely face. Here it is&mdash;the same soul
      breaking through the clay of my Psyche!&mdash;I will give just one touch
      to the corner of the mouth.

    <p>
      <i>Col. G.</i> What, Clara! you here so early!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. C.</i> Well, you know, brother, you're so fond of mystery!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Col. G.</i> It's very kind of you to come! But we must be very careful;
      I can't tell when my master may be home.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. C.</i> Has he been out all night, then?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Col. G.</i> Oh no; he's just gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. C.</i> I never knew him such an early bird. I made sure he was
      safe in bed for a couple of hours yet. But I do trust, Walter, you have
      had enough of this fooling, and are prepared to act like a rational man
      and a gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Col. G.</i> On the contrary, Clara, with my usual obstinacy, I am more
      determined than ever that my boy shall not know me, until, as I told you,
      I have rendered him such service as may prove me not altogether unworthy
      to be his father. Twenty years of neglect will be hard to surmount.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. C.</i> But mere menial service cannot discharge the least portion
      of your obligations. As his father alone can you really serve him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Col. G.</i> You persist in misunderstanding me. This is not the service
      I mean. I scorn the fancy. This is only the means, as I told you plainly
      before, of finding out <i>how</i> I may serve him&mdash;of learning what
      he really needs&mdash;or most desires. If I fail in discovering how to
      recommend myself to him, I shall go back to India, and content myself with
      leaving him a tolerable fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. C.</i> How ever a hair-brained fellow like you, Walter, could have
      made such a soldier!&mdash;Why don't you tell your boy you love him, and
      have done with it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Col. G.</i> I will, as soon as I have proof to back the assertion.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. C.</i> I tell you it is rank pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Col. G.</i> It may be pride, sister; but it is the pride of a repentant
      thief who puts off his confession until he has the money in his hand to
      prove the genuineness of his sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. C.</i> It never <i>was</i> of any use to argue with <i>you</i>,
      Walter; you know that, or at least I know it. So I give up.&mdash;I trust
      you have got over your prejudice against his profession. It is not my
      fault.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Col. G.</i> In truth, I had forgotten the profession&mdash;as you call
      it&mdash;in watching the professor.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. C.</i> And has it not once occurred to you to ask how he may take
      such watching?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Col. G.</i> By the time he is aware of it, he will be ready to
      understand it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. C.</i> But suppose he should discover you before you have thus
      established your position?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Col. G.</i> I must run the risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. C.</i> Suppose then you should thus find out something he would
      not have you know?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Col. G.</i> (<i>hurriedly</i>). Do you imagine his servant might know a
      thing he would hide from his father?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. C.</i> I do not, Walter. I can trust him. But he might well resent
      the espionage of even his father. You cannot get rid of the vile look of
      the thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Col. G.</i> Again I say, my boy shall be my judge, and my love shall be
      my plea. In any case I shall have to ask his forgiveness. But there is his
      key in the lock! Run into the house.

      <i>Ger.</i> What <i>do</i> you mean?

      <i>Col. G.</i> I mean, when there is anything there, he can't well help
      his temper, sir.

    <p>
      <i>Con.</i> I never used to think them rough when I lived among them with
      my father and mother. There must be just as good people there as anywhere
      else. Yet I could not help shuddering at the thought of living there
      again!&mdash;How strange it made me feel! You have been my angel, Arthur.

      <i>Con.</i> No, indeed! I haven't been in a hurry at all. He has been a
      long time trying to make me like him. I have been too long a burden to
      Mrs. Clifford.

      <i>Con.</i> I don't know what you mean by that, Arthur.

      you are engaged to him, then&mdash;

      have him, I knew.&mdash;I ought to do what I can to please her,&mdash;ought
      I not? I have no right to&mdash;

      Only you mustn't marry him, if you&mdash;. Thank you for telling me.

      Don't you know they sent him&mdash;not those women, but the dead people&mdash;to
      look after me? He's a good fellow. He said he would die for me. Ha! ha!
      ha! Not much in that&mdash;is there?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Con.</i> Don't laugh so, dear Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ger.</i> Well, I won't. I have something to tell you, Constance. I will
      try to keep my senses till I've told you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Con.</i> Do tell me. I hope I haven't done anything more to vex you.
      Indeed I am sorry. I won't speak to that man again, if you like. I would
      rather not&mdash;if you wish it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ger.</i> What right have I to dictate to you, my child?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Con.</i> Every right. I am yours. I belong to you. Nobody owned me when
      you took me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ger.</i> Don't talk like that; you will drive me mad.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Con.</i> Arthur! Arthur!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ger.</i> Listen to me, Constance. I am going to Garibaldi. He wants
      soldiers. I must not live an idle life any longer.&mdash;We must part,
      Constance.&mdash;Good-bye, my darling!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Con.</i> No, no; not yet; we'll talk about it by-and-by. You see I
      shall have ever so many things to make for you before you can go! (<i>smiling</i>).
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ger.</i> Garibaldi can't wait, Constance&mdash;and <i>I</i> can't wait.
      I shall die if I stop here.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Con.</i> Oh, Arthur, you are in some trouble, and you won't tell me
      what it is, so I can't help you!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ger.</i> I shall be killed, I know. I mean to be. Will you think of me
      sometimes? Give me one kiss. I may have a last kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Con.</i> (<i>weeping</i>.) My heart will break if you talk like that,
      Arthur. I will do anything you please. There's something wrong, dreadfully
      wrong! And it must be my fault!&mdash;Oh! there's that man! (<i>starting
      up</i>.) He shall <i>not</i> come here.

      ACT II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      SCENE.&mdash;<i>A street in Mayfair</i>. MRS. CLIFFORD'S <i>house. A
      pastrycook's shop. Boys looking in at the window</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bill.</i> I say, Jim, ain't it a lot o' grub? If I wos a pig now,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Jack.</i> I likes to hear Bill a supposin' of hisself. Go it, Bill!&mdash;There
      ain't nothink <i>he</i> can't suppose hisself, Jim.&mdash;Bein' as you
      ain't a pig. Bill, you've got yer own trotters, an' yer own tater-trap.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bill.</i> Vereupon blue Bobby eccosts me with the remark, "I wants you,
      Bill;" and seein' me too parerlyzed to bolt, he pops me in that 'ere jug
      vithout e'er a handle.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Jack.</i> Mother kep' a pig once.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Jim.</i> What was he like, Jack?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Jack.</i> As like any other pig as ever he could look; accep' that
      where other pigs is black he wor white, an' where other pigs is white he
      wor black.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Jim.</i> Did you have the milk in your tea, Jack?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Jack.</i> Pigs ain't got no milk, Jim, you stupe!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bill.</i> Pigs <i>has</i> milk, Jack, only they don't give it to coves.&mdash;I
      wish I wos the Lord Mayor!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Jack.</i> Go it again, Bill. He ought ha' been a beak, Bill ought. What
      'ud you do, Bill, supposin' as how you wos the Lord Mayor?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bill.</i> I'd take all the beaks, an' all the peelers, an' put their
      own bracelets on 'em, an' feed 'em once a day on scraps o' wittles to
      bring out the hunger: a cove can't be hungry upon nuffin at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Jim.</i> He gets what mother calls the squeamishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Jack.</i> Well, Bill?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bill.</i> Well, the worry moment their bellies was as long an' as loose
      as a o'-clo'-bag of a winter's mornin', I'd bring 'em all up to this 'ere
      winder, five or six at a time&mdash;with the darbies on, mind ye&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Jim.</i> And I'm to be there to see, Bill&mdash;ain't I?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bill.</i> If you're good, Jim, an' don't forget yer prayers.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Jack.</i> My eye! it's as good as a penny gaff! Go it, Bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bill.</i> Then I up an' addresses 'em: "My Lords an' Gen'lemen, 'cos as
      how ye're all good boys, an' goes to church, an' don't eat <i>too</i> many
      wittles, an' don't take off your bracelets when you goes to bed, you shall
      obswerve me eat."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Jim.</i> Go it, Bill! I likes you, Bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bill.</i> No, Jim; I must close. The imagination is a 'ungry gift, as
      the cock said when he bolted the pebbles. Let's sojourn the meetin'.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Jack</i>. Yes; come along. 'Tain't a comfable corner this yere: the
      wind cuts round uncommon sharp. Them pies ain't good&mdash;leastways not
      to look at.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bill</i>. They ain't disgestible. But look ye here, Jack and Jim&mdash;hearkee,
      my kids. (<i>Puts an arm round the neck of each, and whispers first to one
      and then to the other</i>.)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    <i>Enter</i> MATTIE <i>and</i> SUSAN.
</pre>
    <p>
      <i>Sus</i>. Now, Mattie, we're close to the house, an' I don't want to be
      seen with you, for she's mad at <i>me</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. You must have made her mad, then, Sue.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sus</i>. She madded me first: what else when she wouldn't believe a
      word I said? She'd ha' sworn on the gospel book, we sent the parcel up the
      spout. But she'll believe <i>you</i>, an' give you something, and then
      we'll have a chop!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. How can you expect that, Sue, when the work's lost?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sus</i>. Never mind; you go and see.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. I shan't take it, Susan. I couldn't.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sus</i>. Stuff and nonsense! I'll wait you round the corner: I don't
      like the smell o' them pastry things.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    <i>Exit</i>. MATTIE <i>walks past the window</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. I don't like going. It makes me feel a thief to be suspected.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bill</i>. Lor! it's our Mattie! There's our Mattie!&mdash;Mattie!
      Mattie!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. Ah, Bill! you're there&mdash;are you?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bill</i>. Yes, Mattie. It's a tart-show. You walks up and takes yer
      chice;&mdash;leastways, you makes it: somebody else takes it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. Wouldn't you like to <i>take</i> your choice sometimes, Bill?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bill</i>. In course I would.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. Then why don't you work, and better yourself a bit?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bill</i>. Bless you, Mattie! myself is werry comf'able. He never
      complains.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. You're hungry sometimes,&mdash;ain't you?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bill</i>. Most remarkable 'ungry, Mattie&mdash;this werry moment. Odd
      you should ask now&mdash;ain't it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. You would get plenty to eat if you would work.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bill</i>. Thank you&mdash;I'd rayther not. Them as ain't 'ungry never
      enj'ys their damaged tarts. If I'm 'appy, vere's the odds? as the cat said
      to the mouse as wanted to be let off the engagement. Why should I work
      more'n any other gen'leman?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. A gentleman that don't work is a curse to his neighbours,
      Bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bill</i>. Bless you, Mattie! I ain't a curse&mdash;nohow to nobody. I
      don't see as you've got any call to say that, Mattie. I don't go fakin'
      clies, or crackin' cribs&mdash;nothin' o' the sort. An' I don't mind doin'
      of a odd job, if it <i>is</i> a odd one. Don't go for to say that again,
      Mattie.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. I won't, then, Bill. But just look at yourself!&mdash;You're
      all in rags.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bill</i>. Rags is the hairier, as the Skye terrier said to the
      black-an'-tan.&mdash;I shouldn't object to a new pair of old trousers,
      though.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. Why don't you have a pair of real new ones? If you would only
      sweep a crossing&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bill</i>. There ain't, a crossin' but what's took. Besides, my legs
      ain't put together for one place all day long. It ain't to be done,
      Mattie. They can't do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. There's the shoe-black business, then.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bill</i>. That ain't so bad, acause you can shoulder your box and
      trudge. But if it's all the same to you, Mattie, I'd rayther enj'y life:
      they say it's short.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. But it ain't the same to me. It's so bad for you to be idle,
      Bill!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bill</i>. Not as I knows on. I'm tollable jolly, so long's I gets the
      browns for my bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. Wouldn't you like a bed with a blanket to it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bill</i>. Well, yes&mdash;if it was guv to me. But I don't go in for
      knocking of yourself about, to sleep warm.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. Well, look here, Bill. It's all Susan and I can do to pay for
      our room, and get a bit of bread and a cup of tea. It ain't enough.&mdash;If
      you were to earn a few pence now&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bill</i>. Oh golly! I never thought o' that. What a hass I wur, to be
      sure! I'll go a shoe-blackin' to-morror&mdash;I will.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. Did you ever black a shoe, Bill?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bill</i>. I tried a boot oncet&mdash;when Jim wor a blackin' for a day
      or two. But I made nothink on it&mdash;nothink worth mentionin'. The
      blackin' or som'at was wrong. The gen'leman said it wur coal-dust, an he'd
      slog me, an' adwised me to go an' learn my trade.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. And what did you say to that?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bill</i>. Holler'd out "Shine yer boots!" as loud as I could holler.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. You must try my boots next time you come.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bill</i>. This wery night, Mattie. I'll make 'em shine like plate glass&mdash;see
      then if I don't. But where'll I get a box and brushes?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. You shall have our brushes and my footstool.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bill</i>. I see! Turn the stool upside down, put the brushes in, and
      carry it by one leg&mdash;as drunken Moll does her kid.&mdash;Here you
      are, sir! Black your boots, sir?&mdash;Shine your trotters, sir? (<i>bawling</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. That'll do; that'll do, Bill! Famous! You needn't do it again
      (<i>holding her ears</i>). Would you like a tart?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bill</i>. Just wouldn't I, then!&mdash;Shine your boooooots!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. (<i>laughing</i>). Do hold your tongue, Bill. There's a penny
      for a tart.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bill</i>. Thank you, Mattie. Thank you.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. No, Susan, it ain't. It's the free look of them&mdash;and the
      head up&mdash;and the white hands&mdash;and the taper fingers. They're
      stronger than us, and they're that trained like, that all their body goes
      in one, like the music at a concert. <i>I</i> couldn't pick up a needle
      without going down on my knees after it. It's the pain in my side, Sue.&mdash;Yes,
      it's a fine thing to be born a lady. It's <i>not</i> the clothes, Sue. If
      we was dressed ever so, we couldn't come near them. It's that look,&mdash;I
      don't know what.
    </p>

      <i>Sus</i>. Speak for yerself, Mattie; <i>I</i>'m not a goin' to think

      been took in time&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. It's a big <i>if</i> that though, Sue.&mdash;And then she
      looked <i>so</i> good! You'd hardly think it of me,&mdash;perhaps it's
      because I'm dying&mdash;but for one minute I could ha' kissed her very
      shoes. Oh, my side!

      it Mattie, dear?&mdash;a little teeny bit?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. Yes, Sukey. It holds it together a bit. Will he break her
      heart too, I wonder?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sus</i>. No fear o' that! Ladies takes care o' theirselves. They're
      brought up to it.

    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. It's only poor girls gentlemen don't mind hurting, I suppose.

      not if I was to die for it. But what came of it, child?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. I made some noise, I suppose, and the lady started.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sus</i>. And then you up and spoke?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. I turned sick, and fell down.

    <p>
      <i>Sus</i>. Poor dear!

    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. She got me a glass of wine, but I couldn't swallow it, and got
      up and crawled out.

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sus</i>. You'll tell her, in course?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. No, Sue; he'd hate me, and I couldn't bear that. Oh me! my
      side! It's so bad!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sus</i>. Let's try for home, Mattie. It's a long way, and there's
      nothing to eat when you're there; but you can lie down, and that's

      <i>Wat</i>. (<i>aside</i>) The very rascal I saw her speaking to! But

      some of them capable of it. I'll set her up for life. I'd give a cool

      <i>Wat</i>. Rather tall&mdash;thin&mdash;dark hair&mdash;large dark eyes&mdash;and
      long white hands. Her name's Matilda&mdash;Mattie Pearson&mdash;the girl
      you were talking to, I tell you, on this very spot an hour or two ago.

      If you say her it was, I'll detect her for ye.

      <i>Wat</i>. Well, Timothy&mdash;there's the other sov.&mdash;and it's
      yours the moment you take me to her. Look at it.

    <p>
      <i>Bill</i>. My eye!&mdash;Is she a square Moll, sir?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Wat</i>. What do you mean by that?

    <p>
      <i>Bill</i>. Green you are, to be sure!&mdash;She ain't one as steals, or&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Wat</i>. Not she. She's a sempstress&mdash;a needlewoman, or something
      of the sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bill</i>. And where shall I find <i>you</i>, sir?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Wat</i>. Let me see:&mdash;to-morrow night&mdash;on the steps of St.
      Martin's Church&mdash;ten o'clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bill</i>. But if I don't find her? It may be a week&mdash;or a month&mdash;or&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Wat</i>. Come whether you find her or not, and let me know.
    </p>

      the very worst boys in all London.

    <i>Enter from the house</i> MRS. CLIFFORD. <i>Enter from opposite side</i>
    COL. G.
</pre>
    <p>
      <i>Col. G.</i> I was just coming to see you, Clara.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. C.</i> And I was going to see you. How's Arthur to-day? I thought
      you would have come yesterday.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Col. G.</i> My poor boy is as dependent on me as if I were <i>not</i>
      his father. I am very anxious about him. The fever keeps returning.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. C.</i> Fortune seems to have favoured your mad scheme, Walter.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Col. G.</i> Or something better than fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. C.</i> You have had rare and ample opportunity. You may end the
      farce when you please, and in triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Col. G.</i> On the contrary, Clara, it would be nothing but an
      anticlimax to end what you are pleased to call <i>the farce</i> now. As if
      I could make a merit of nursing my own boy! I did more for my black
      servant. I wish I had him here.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. C.</i> You would like to double the watch&mdash;would you?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Col. G.</i> Something has vexed you, Clara.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. C.</i> I never liked the scheme, and I like it less every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Col. G.</i> I have had no chance yet. He has been ill all the time. I
      wish you would come and see him a little oftener.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. C.</i> He doesn't want me. You are everything now. Besides, I
      can't come alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Col G.</i> Why not?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. C.</i> Constance would fancy I did not want to take her.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Col. G.</i> Then why not take her?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. C.</i> I have my reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Col. G.</i> What are they?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. C.</i> Never mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Col. G.</i> I insist upon knowing them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. C.</i> It would break my heart, Walter, to quarrel with you, but I
      <i>will</i> if you use such an expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Col. G.</i> But why shouldn't you bring Miss Lacordre with you?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. C.</i> He's but a boy, and it might put some nonsense in his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Col. G.</i> She's a fine girl. You make a friend of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. C.</i> She's a good girl, and a lady-like girl; but I don't want
      to meddle with the bulwarks of society. I hope to goodness they will last
      <i>my</i> time.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Col. G.</i> Clara, I begin to doubt whether pride <i>be</i> a Christian
      virtue.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. C.</i> I see! You'll be a radical before long. <i>Every</i>thing
      is going that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Col. G.</i> I don't care what I am, so I do what's right. I'm sick of
      all that kind of thing. What I want is bare honesty. I believe I'm a tory
      as yet, but I should be a radical to-morrow if I thought justice lay on
      that side.&mdash;If a man falls in love with a woman, why shouldn't he
      marry her?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. C.</i> She may be unfit for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Col. G.</i> How should he fall in love with her, then? Men don't fall
      in love with birds.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. C.</i> It's a risk&mdash;a great risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Col. G.</i> None the greater that he pleases himself, and all the more
      worth taking. I wish my poor boy&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. C.</i> Your poor boy might please himself and yet not succeed in
      pleasing you, brother!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Col. G. (aside</i>). She <i>knows</i> something.&mdash;I must go and
      see about his dinner. Good-bye, sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. C.</i> Good-bye, then. You will have your own way!

    <h3>
      SCENE.&mdash;<i>A garret-room</i>. MATTIE. SUSAN.
    </h3>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. At the worst we've got to die some day, Sue, and I don't know
      but hunger may be as easy a way as another.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sus</i>. I'd rather have a choice, though. And it's not hunger I would
      choose.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. There are worse ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sus</i>. Never mind: we don't seem likely to be bothered wi' choosin'.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. There's that button-hole done. (<i>Lays down her work with a
      sigh, and leans back in her chair</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sus</i>. I'll take it to old Nathan. It'll be a chop a-piece. It's
      wonderful what a chop can do to hearten you up.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. I don't think we ought to buy chops, dear. We must be content
      with bread, I think.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sus</i>. Bread, indeed!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. Well, it's something to eat.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sus</i>. Do you call it eatin' when you see a dog polishin' a bone?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. Bread's very good with a cup of tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sus</i>. Tea, indeed! Fawn-colour, trimmed with sky-blue!&mdash;If
      you'd mentioned lobster-salad and sherry, now!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. I never tasted lobster-salad.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sus</i>. I have, though; and I do call lobster-salad good. You don't
      care about your wittles: <i>I</i> do. When I'm hungry, I'm not at all
      comfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. Poor dear Sue! There is a crust in the cupboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sus</i>. I <i>can't</i> eat crusts. I want summat nice. I ain't dyin'
      of 'unger. It's only I'm peckish. <i>Very</i> peckish, though. I could eat&mdash;let
      me see what I <i>could</i> eat:&mdash;I could eat a lobster-salad, and two
      dozen oysters, and a lump of cake, and a wing and a leg of a chicken&mdash;if
      it was a spring chicken, with watercreases round it&mdash;and a Bath-bun,
      and a sandwich; and in fact I don't know what I couldn't eat, except just
      that crust in the cupboard. And I do believe I could drink a whole bottle
      of champagne.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. I don't know what one of those things tastes like&mdash;scarce
      one; and I don't believe you do either.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sus</i>. Don't I?&mdash;I never did taste champagne, but I've seen them
      eating lobster-salad many a time;&mdash;girls not half so good-lookin' as
      you or me, Mattie, and fine gentlemen a waitin' upon 'em. Oh dear! I <i>am</i>
      so hungry! Think of having your supper with a real gentleman as talks to
      you as if you was fit to talk to&mdash;not like them Jew-tailors, as
      tosses your work about as if it dirtied their fingers&mdash;and them none
      so clean for all their fine rings!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. I saw Nathan's Joseph in a pastrycook's last Saturday, and a
      very pretty girl with him, poor thing!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sus</i>. Oh the hussy to let that beast pay for her!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. I suppose she was hungry.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sus</i>. I'd die before I let a snob like that treat <i>me</i>. No,
      Mattie! I spoke of a <i>real</i> gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. Are you sure you wouldn't take Nathan's Joseph for a gentleman
      if he was civil to you?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sus</i>. Thank you, miss! I know a sham from a real gentleman the
      moment I set eyes on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. What do you mean by a real gentleman, Susan?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sus</i>. A gentleman as makes a lady of his girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. But what sort of lady, Sue? The poor girl may fancy herself a
      lady, but only till she's left in the dirt. That sort of gentleman makes
      fine speeches to your face, and calls you horrid names behind your back.
      Sue, dear, don't have a word to say to one of them&mdash;if he speaks ever
      so soft.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sus</i>. Lawks, Mattie! they ain't all one sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. You won't have more than one sort to choose from. They may be
      rough or civil, good-natured or bad, but they're all the same in this,
      that not one of them cares a pin more for you than if you was a horse&mdash;no&mdash;nor
      half a quarter so much. Don't for God's sake have a word to say to one of
      them. If I die, Susan&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sus</i>. If you do, Matilda&mdash;if you go and do that thing, I'll
      take to gin&mdash;that's what I'll do. Don't say I didn't act fair, and
      tell you beforehand.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. How can I help dying, Susan?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sus</i>. I say, Don't do it, Mattie. We'll fall out, if you do. Don't
      do it, Matilda&mdash;La! there's that lumping Bill again&mdash;<i>al</i>ways
      a comin' up the stair when you don't want him!
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    <i>Enter</i> BILL.
</pre>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. Well, Bill, how have you been getting on?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bill</i>. Pretty tollol, Mattie. But I can't go on so. (<i>Holds out
      his stool</i>.) It ain't respectable.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. What ain't respectable? Everything's respectable that's
      honest.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bill</i>. Why, who ever saw a respectable shiner goin' about with a
      three-legged stool for a blackin' box? It ain't the thing. The rig'lars
      chaffs me fit to throw it at their 'eads, they does&mdash;only there's too
      many on 'em, an' I've got to dror it mild. A box I must have, or a
      feller's ockypation's gone. Look ye here! One bob, one tanner, and a joey!
      There! that's what comes of never condescending to an 'a'penny.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sus</i>. Bless us! what mighty fine words we've got a waitin' on us!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bill</i>. If I 'ave a weakness, Miss Susan, it's for the right word in
      the right place&mdash;as the coster said to the devil-dodger as blowed him
      up for purfane swearin'.&mdash;When a gen'leman hoffers me an 'a'penny, I
      axes him in the purlitest manner I can assume, to oblige me by givin' of
      it to the first beggar he may 'ave the good fort'n to meet. <i>Some</i> on
      'em throws down the 'a'penny. Most on 'em makes it a penny.&mdash;But I
      say, Mattie, you don't want nobody arter you&mdash;do you now?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. I don't know what you mean by that, Bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bill</i>. You don't want a father&mdash;do you now? Do she, Susan?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sus</i>. We want no father a hectorin' here, Bill. You 'ain't seen one
      about, have you?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bill</i>. I seen a rig'lar swell arter Mattie, anyhow.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. What do you mean, Bill? Bill. A rig'lar swell&mdash;I repeats
      it&mdash;a astin' arter a young woman by the name o' Mattie.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sus</i>. (<i>pulling him aside</i>). Hold your tongue, Bill! You'll
      kill her! You young viper! Hold your tongue, or I'll twist your neck.
      Don't you see how white she is?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. What was he like? Do tell me, Bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bill</i>. A long-legged rig'lar swell, with a gold chain, and a cane
      with a hivory 'andle.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sus</i>. He's a bad man, Bill, and Mattie can't abide him. If you tell
      him where she is, she'll never speak to you again.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. Oh, Susan! what <i>shall</i> I do? Don't bring him here, Bill.
      I shall have to run away again; and I can't, for we owe a week's rent.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sus</i>. There, Bill!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bill</i>. Don't you be afeard, Mattie. He shan't touch you. Nor the old
      one neither.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. There wasn't an old man with him?&mdash;not an old man with a
      long stick?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bill</i>. Not with <i>him</i>. Daddy was on his own hook?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. It must have been my father, Susan. (<i>Sinks back on her
      chair</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sus</i>. 'Tain't the least likely.&mdash;There, Bill! I always said you
      was no good! You've killed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bill</i>. Mattie! Mattie! I didn't tell him where you was.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. (<i>reviving</i>). Run and fetch him, Bill&mdash;there's a
      dear! Oh! how proud I've been! If mother did say a hard word, she didn't
      mean it&mdash;not for long. Run, Bill, run and fetch him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bill</i>. Mattie, I was a fetchin' of him, but he wouldn't trust me.
      And didn't he cut up crusty, and collar me tight! He's a game old cock&mdash;he
      is, Mattie.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. (<i>getting up and pacing about the room</i>). Oh, Susan! my
      heart'll break. To think he's somewhere near and I can't get to him! Oh my
      side! <i>Don't</i> you know where he is, Bill?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bill</i>. He's someveres about, and blow me if I don't, find him!&mdash;a
      respectable old party in a white pinny, an' 'peared as if he'd go on a
      walkin' till he walked hisself up staudin'. A scrumptious old party!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. Had he a stick, Bill?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bill</i>. Yes&mdash;a knobby stick&mdash;leastways a stick wi' knobs
      all over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. That's him, Susan!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bill</i>. I could swear to the stick. I was too near gittin' at the
      taste on it not to know it again.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. When was it you saw him, Bill?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bill</i>. Yesterday, Mattie&mdash;jest arter you give me the tart. I
      sawr him again this mornin', but he wouldn't place no confidence in me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. Oh dear! Why didn't you come straight to me, Bill?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bill</i>. If I'd only ha' known as you wanted him! But that was sech a
      <i>un</i>likely thing! It's werry perwokin'! I uses my judgment, an' puts
      my hoof in it! I <i>am</i> sorry, Mattie. But I didn't know no better (<i>crying</i>).
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. Don't cry, Bill. You'll find him for me yet&mdash;won't you?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bill</i>. I'm off this indentical minute. But you see&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sus</i>. There! there!&mdash;now you mizzle. <i>I</i> don't want no
      fathers here&mdash;goodness knows; but the poor girl's took a fancy to
      hers, and she'll die if she don't get him. Run now&mdash;there's a good
      boy! (<i>Exit</i> BILL.) You 'ain't forgotten who's a comin', Mattie?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. No, indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sus</i>. Well, I hope she'll be civil, or I'll just give her a bit of
      my mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. Not enough to change hers, I'm afraid. That sort of thing
      never does any good.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sus</i>. And am I to go a twiddlin' of my thumbs, and sayin' <i>yes,
      ma'am</i>, an' <i>no, ma'am</i>? Not if I knows it, Matilda!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. You will only make her the more positive in her ill opinion of
      us.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sus</i>. An' what's that to me?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. Well, I don't like to be thought a thief. Besides, Mrs.
      Clifford has been kind to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sus</i>. She's paid us for work done; so has old Nathan.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. Did old Nathan ever give you a glass of wine when you took
      home his slops?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sus</i>. Oh! that don't cost much; and besides, she takes it out in
      kingdom-come.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. You're unfair, Susan.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sus</i>. Well, it's little fairness I get.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. And to set that right you're unfair yourself! What you call
      speaking your mind, is as cheap, and as nasty, as the worst shoddy old
      Nathan ever got gobble-stitched into coats and trousers.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sus</i>. Very well, Miss Matilda! (<i>rising and snatching her bonnet</i>).
      The sooner we part the better! You stick by your fine friends! I don't
      care <i>that</i> for them! (<i>snapping her fingers</i>)&mdash;and you may
      tell 'em so! I can make a livin' without them or you either. Goodness

      <i>Mat</i>. Indeed, ma'am, she's an honest girl.

    <p>
      <i>Mrs. C.</i> She is a low creature, and capable of anything. I advise
      you to get rid of her.

    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. Was she rude on the stair, ma'am?

    <p>
      <i>Mrs. C.</i> Rude! Vulgar&mdash;quite vulgar! Insulting!

      girl, and never pawned that work. It was done&mdash;every stitch of it;
      and the loss of the money is hard upon us too. Indeed, ma'am, she did lose
      the parcel.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. C.</i> You have only her word for it. If you don't give <i>her</i>
      up, I give <i>you</i> up.

    <p>
      <i>Mrs. C.</i> She can't well get into worse. Her language! You would do
      ever so much better without her.

    <p>
      <i>Mrs. C.</i> I see! I thought as much!

      <i>Sus</i>. She daren't do it&mdash;the old scrooge! But just let her try
      it on! See if I don't show her up afore the magistrate! Mattie! I'll work
      my fingers to the bone for you. I would do worse, only you won't let me.
      I'll go to the court, and tell the magistrate you're a-dyin' of hunger,
      which it's as true as gospel.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. They'd send me to the workhouse, Sukey.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sus</i>. There <i>must</i> be some good people somewheres, Mattie.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. Yes; if we could get at them. But we can live till we die,
      Sukey.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sus</i>. I'll go and list for a soldier, I will. Women ha' done it
      afore. It's quite respectable, so long as they don't find you out&mdash;and
      they shouldn't me. There's ne'er a one o' the redcoats 'ill cut up rougher

    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sus</i>. Do you care to have me, then?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. That I do, indeed. But you shouldn't have talked like that to
      Mrs. Clifford. Ladies ain't used to such words. They sound worse than they
      are&mdash;quite dreadful, to them. She don't know your kind heart as I do.
      Besides, the <i>look</i> of things is against us. Ain't it now? Say
      yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sus</i>. (<i>starting up</i>) I'll go and beg her pardon. I'll go
      direckly&mdash;I will. I swear I will. I can't abear her, but I'll do it.
      I believe hunger has nigh drove me mad.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. It takes all the madness out of me.&mdash;No, Susan; we must
      bear it now. Come along. We can be miserable just as well working. There's

      dear!

    <p>
      <i>Sus</i>. I <i>will</i> cry. It's all I ever could do to my own mind,
      and it's all as is left me. But if I could get my claws on that lovyer o'
      yours, I wouldn't cry then. He's at the bottom of it! I don't see myself
      what's the use of fallin' in love. One man's as much of a fool as another
      to me. But you must go to bed. You ain't fit. You'll be easier when you've
      got your frock off. There! Why, child, you're all of a tremble!&mdash;And
      no wonder, wi' nothing on her blessed body but her frock and her shimmy!

      <i>Sus</i>. Lie down a bit, anyhow. I'll lie at your back, and you'll soon
      be as warm's a toast. (MAT. <i>lies down</i>.) O Lord! she's dead! Her

      <i>Sus</i>. I won't never no more again, sir&mdash;not if Mattie don't
      drive me to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Con</i>. (<i>to</i> COL. G.). Come back for me in a little while.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Col. G.</i> Yes, miss. Come, Bill. <i>Exit</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bill</i>. All right, sir. I'm a follerin', as the cat said to the
      pigeon. <i>Exit</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sus</i>. I'll just go and get you a cup o' tea. Mrs. Jones's kettle's
      sure to be a bilin'. That's what you would like.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    <i>Exit</i>. <i>Constance steps aside, and Susan passes without seeing her</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. Oh! to be a baby again in my mother's arms! But it'll soon be
      over now.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    CONSTANCE <i>comes forward</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      <i>Con</i>. I hope you're a little better now?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. You're very kind, miss; and I beg your pardon for speaking to
      you as I did.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Con</i>. Don't say a word about it. You didn't quite know what you were
      saying. I'm in trouble myself. I don't know how soon I may be worse off
      than you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. Why, miss, I thought you were going to be married!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Con</i>. No, I am not.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. Why, miss, what's happened. He's never going to play <i>you</i>
      false&mdash;is he?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Con</i>. I don't mean ever to speak to him again?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. What has he done to offend you, miss?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Con</i>. Nothing. Only I know now I don't like him. To tell you the
      truth, Mattie, he's not a gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. Not a gentleman, miss! How dare you say so?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Con</i>. Do <i>you</i> know anything about him? Did you ever see him?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Con</i>. Where?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. Once at your house.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Con</i>. Oh! I remember&mdash;that time! I begin to&mdash;It couldn't
      be at the sight of him you fainted, Mattie?&mdash;You knew him? Tell me!
      tell me! Make me sure of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. To give you your revenge! No. It's a mean spite to say he
      ain't a gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Con</i>. Perhaps you and I have different ideas of what goes to make a
      gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. Very likely.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Con</i>. Oh! don't be vexed, Mattie. I didn't mean to hurt you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. Oh! I dare say!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Con</i>. If you talk to me like that, I must go.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. I never asked you to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Con</i>. Well, I did want to be friendly with you. I wouldn't hurt you
      for the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. (<i>bursting into tears</i>) I beg your pardon, miss. I'm
      behaving like a brute. But you must forgive me; my heart is breaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Con</i>. Poor dear! (<i>kissing her</i>) So is mine almost. Let us be
      friends. Where's Susan gone?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. To fetch me a cup of tea. She'll be back directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Con</i>. Don't let her say bad words: I can't bear them. I think it's
      because I was so used to them once&mdash;in the streets, I mean&mdash;not
      at home&mdash;never at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. She don't often, miss. She's a good-hearted creature. It's
      only when hunger makes her cross. She don't like to be hungry.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Con</i>. I should think not, poor girl!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. Don't mind what she says, please. If you say nothing, she'll
      come all right. When she's spoken her mind, she feels better. Here she
      comes!
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    <i>Re-enter</i> SUSAN. <i>It begins to grow dark</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      <i>Sus</i>. Well, and who have we got here?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. Miss Lacordre, Sukey.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sus</i>. There's no lack o' dare about <i>her</i>, to come here!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. It's very kind of her to come, Susan.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sus</i>. I tell you what, miss: that parcel was stole. It <i>was</i>
      stole, miss!&mdash;stole from me&mdash;an' that angel there a dyin' in the
      street!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Con</i>. I'm quite sure of it, Susan. I never thought anything else.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sus</i>. Not but I allow it was a pity, miss!&mdash;I'm very sorry.
      But, bless you! (<i>lighting a candle</i>)&mdash;with all <i>your</i> fine
      clothes&mdash;! My! you look like a theayter-queen&mdash;you do, miss! If
      you was to send <i>them</i> up the spout now!&mdash;My! what a lot they'd
      let you have on that silk!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Con</i>. The shawl is worth a good deal, I believe. It's an Indian one&mdash;all
      needlework.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sus</i>. And the bee-utiful silk! Laws, miss! just shouldn't I like to
      wear a frock like that! I <i>should</i> be hard up before I pledged <i>that</i>!
      But the shawl! If I was you, miss, I would send 'most everything up before
      that!&mdash;things inside, you know, miss&mdash;where it don't matter so
      much.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Con</i>. (<i>laughing</i>) The shawl would be the first thing I should
      part with. I would rather be nice inside than out.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sus</i>. Lawk, miss! I shouldn't wonder if that was one of the differs
      now! Well, I never! It ain't seen! It must be one o' the differs!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Con</i>. What differs? I don't understand you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sus</i>. The differs 'tween girls an' ladies&mdash;girls like me an'
      real ladies like you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Con</i>. Oh, I see! But how dark it has got! What can be keeping
      William? I must go at once, or what will my aunt say! Would you mind going
      with me a little bit, Susan?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sus</i>. I'll go with pleasure, miss.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Con</i>. Just a little way, I mean, till we get to the wide streets.
      You couldn't lend me an old cloak, could you?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sus</i>. I 'ain't got one stitch, miss, but what I stand up in&mdash;'cep'
      it be a hodd glove an' 'alf a pocket-'an'kercher. Nobody 'ill know you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Con</i>. But I oughtn't to be out dressed like this.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sus</i>. You've only got to turn up your skirt over your head, miss.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Con</i>. (<i>drawing up her skirt</i>) I never thought of that!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sus</i>. Well, I never!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Con</i>. What's the matter?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sus</i>. Only the whiteness o' the linin' as took my breath away, miss.
      It ain't no use turnin' of <i>it</i> up: you'll look like a lady whatever
      you do to hide it. But never mind: that ain't no disgrace so long as you
      don't look down on the rest of us. There, miss! There you are&mdash;fit
      for a play! Come along; I'll take care of you. Lawks! I'm as good as a man&mdash;<i>I</i>
      am!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Con</i>. Good-bye then, Mattie.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mat</i>. Good-bye, miss. God bless you.

      <i>Col. G.</i> Thank heaven! If Bill has found Mr. Warren now,&mdash;<i>Exit</i>.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    <i>Enter</i> WARREN.
</pre>
    <p>
      <i>War</i>. What can the fellow be up to? There's something odd about him&mdash;something
      I don't like&mdash;but it can't mean mischief when he sends for me. Where
      could Gervaise have picked him up?&mdash;Nobody here?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    <i>Re-enter</i> COL. G. <i>and hurries to him with outstretched hand</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      <i>Col. G.</i> My dear sir! I am greatly obliged to you. This is very
      kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>War</i>. (<i>stepping back</i>) Excuse me.&mdash;I do not understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Col. G.</i> I beg your pardon. I ought to have explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>War</i>. I believe something of the sort <i>is</i> necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Col. G.</i> You are my master's friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>War</i>. I should be proud of the honour. Can I be of any service to
      him?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Col. G.</i> I believe I can trust you. I <i>will</i> trust you&mdash;I
      am his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>War</i>. Whose father? Belzebub's?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Col. G.</i> Arthur's&mdash;your friend Gervaise's. I am Sir Walter
      Gervaise. You must help me to help him.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    WARREN <i>regards him for a moment</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      <i>War</i>. (<i>stiffly</i>) Sir Walter, I owe your son much&mdash;you
      nothing yet. I am <i>his</i> friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Col. G.</i> There is not a moment to lose. Listen. An old man came
      about the place a few weeks ago, looking for his daughter. He has been got
      out of the way, but I have learned where he is: I want you to bring him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>War</i>. I would serve your son blindfold: <i>you</i> must excuse me if
      I wish to understand first.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Col. G.</i> Arthur is in trouble. He has a secret.&mdash;God forgive
      me!&mdash;I feared it was a bad one.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>War</i>. You don't know him as I do!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Col. G.</i> I know him now&mdash;and can help him. Only I can't <i>prove</i>
      anything yet. I must have the old man. I've found his daughter, and
      suspect the villain: if I can bring the three together, all will come out,
      sure enough. The boy I sent for you will take you to the father. He will
      trust you, and come. (<i>Bell rings</i>.) I must go to Arthur now. <i>Exit</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>War</i>. What a strange old fellow! An officer&mdash;and disguise
      himself!

    <p>
      <i>Bill</i>. Here you are, sir!

    <p>
      <i>War</i>. No vast amount of information in that statement, my boy!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bill</i>. Well, sir&mdash;here <i>I</i> are, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>War</i>. That <i>is</i> a trifle more to the point, though scarcely
      requiring mention.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bill</i>. Then, here <i>we</i> are, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>War</i>. That'll do&mdash;if you know what comes next?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bill</i>. I do, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>War</i>. Go on, then.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bill</i>. Here goes! Come along, sir. You'll have to take a bobby,
      though.
    </p>

      <i>War</i>. We'll see about that. You go on.

</pre>
    <p>
      <i>Ger.</i> What a time you have been, William!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Col. G.</i> I'm sorry, sir. Did you want anything?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ger.</i> No. But I don't like to be left. You are the only friend I
      have.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Col. G.</i> Thank you, sir. A man <i>must</i> do his duty, but it's a
      comfort when his colonel takes notice of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ger.</i> Is it <i>all</i> from duty, William? Yet why should I look for
      more? There was a little girl I tried to do my duty by once&mdash;My
      head's rather queer still, William.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Col. G.</i> Is there nothing to be done, sir?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ger.</i> No; it's here&mdash;(<i>putting his hand to his head</i>)&mdash;inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Col. G.</i> I meant about the little girl, sir.&mdash;I can keep dark
      as well as another.&mdash;When there's anything on a man's mind, sir&mdash;good
      <i>or</i> bad&mdash;it's a relief to mention it. If you could trust me&mdash;(<i>A
      pause</i>.) Men <i>have</i> trusted their servants and not repented it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ger.</i> No doubt&mdash;no doubt. But there is no help for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Col. G.</i> You cannot be sure of that, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ger.</i> You would help me if you could, I believe.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Col. G.</i> God knows I would, sir&mdash;to the last drop of my blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ger.</i> That's saying much, William. A son couldn't say more&mdash;no,
      nor a father either.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Col. G.</i> Oh! yes, he could, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ger.</i> And mean it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Col. G.</i> Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ger.</i> If I had a father, William, I would tell him all about it. I
      was but two years old when he left me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Col. G.</i> Then you don't remember him, sir?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ger.</i> I often dream about him, and then I seem to remember him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Col. G.</i> What is he like, sir?&mdash;in your dreams, I mean.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ger.</i> I never see him distinctly: I try hard sometimes, but it's no
      use. If he would but come home! I feel as if I could bear anything then.&mdash;But
      I'm talking like a girl!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Col. G.</i> Where is your father, sir?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ger.</i> In India.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Col. G.</i> A soldier, sir?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ger.</i> Yes. Colonel Gervaise&mdash;you must have heard of him. Sir
      Walter he is now.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Col. G.</i> I've heard of <i>him</i>, sir&mdash;away in the north parts
      he's been, mostly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ger.</i> Yes. How I wish he would come home! I would do everything to
      please him. I have it, William! I'll go to India. I did think of going to
      Garibaldi&mdash;but I won't&mdash;I'll go to India. I <i>must</i> find my
      father. Will you go with me?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Col. G.</i> Willingly, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ger.</i> Is there any fighting there now?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Col. G.</i> Not at present, I believe.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ger.</i> That's a pity. I would have listed in my father's regiment,
      and then&mdash;that is, by the time he found me out&mdash;he wouldn't be
      ashamed of me. I've done nothing yet. I'm nobody yet, and what could he do
      with a son that was nobody&mdash;a great man like him! A fine son <i>I</i>
      should be! A son ought to be worthy of his father. Don't you think so,
      William?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Col. G.</i> That wouldn't be difficult, sir!&mdash;I mean with most
      fathers.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ger.</i> Ah! but <i>mine</i>, you know, William!&mdash;Are you good at
      the cut and thrust?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Col G.</i> Pretty good, sir, I believe.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ger.</i> Then we'll have a bout or two. I've got rusty.&mdash;Have I
      said anything odd&mdash;or&mdash;or&mdash;I mean since I've been ill?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Col. G.</i> Nothing you need mind, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ger.</i> I'm glad of that.&mdash;I feel as if&mdash;(<i>putting his
      hand to his head</i>). William! what could you do for a man&mdash;if he
      was your friend?&mdash;no, I mean, if he was your enemy?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Col. G.</i> I daren't say, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ger.</i> Is the sun shining?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Col. G.</i> Yes, sir. It's a lovely day.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ger.</i> What a desert the sky is!&mdash;so dreary and wide and waste!&mdash;Ah!
      if I might but creep into a hole in a tree, and feel it closing about me!
      How comfortable those toads must feel!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Col. G.</i> (<i>aside</i>). He's getting light-headed again! I must
      send for the doctor. <i>Exit</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ger.</i> But the tree would rot, and the walls grow thin, and the light
      come through. It is crumbling now! And I shall have to meet <i>her</i>!
      And then the wedding! Oh my God! (<i>Starts up and paces about the room</i>.)&mdash;It
      <i>is</i> the only way! My pistols, I think&mdash;yes.&mdash;(<i>Goes to a
      table, finds his keys, and unlocks a case</i>.)&mdash;There they are! I
      may as well have a passport at hand! (<i>Loading one</i>.)&mdash;The
      delicate thunder-tube! (<i>Turns it over lovingly</i>.) Solitude and

    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Col. G.</i> There's generally a chance to be had, sir. There's always a
      right and a wrong fighting it out somewhere. There's Garibaldi in the

      me would be my best friend.&mdash;Yes&mdash;Garibaldi!&mdash;I don't
      deserve it, though: he fights for his country; I should fight but for
      death. Only a man doesn't stop when he dies&mdash;does he, William?

      <i>Col. G.</i> I trust not, sir. But he may hope to be quieter&mdash;that

      <i>Ger.</i> Yes; that's it&mdash;that's where I'm going. But not to-day.
      Look at my arm: it wouldn't kill a rat!&mdash;You saved my life, but I'm
      not grateful. If I was dead, I might be watching her&mdash;out of the
      lovely silence!&mdash;My poor Psyche!

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
